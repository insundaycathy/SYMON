\xef\xbb\xbfIf a serial killer\xe2\x80\x99s soul inhabited a toy doll you bought for your son, what would you do?  In this How to Beat video, we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow the Barclays, see if we can make better decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat Chucky in Child's Play. If you think you have a better way, let me know in the comments! If you like these how to beat videos, consider liking and subscribing. We start out following Charles Lee Ray, a serial killer on the run from homicide detective Mike Norris. His getaway driver, Eddie Caputo, panics when the cops show up and takes off without him. Should have hired Baby instead. He gets cornered into a toy store and takes a shot to the right lung.  This store can\xe2\x80\x99t be that big. Shouting your monologue like that should make it easy for Mike to find and kill you. They obviously upped the reverb in the audio for effect, because there\xe2\x80\x99s no way Mike would be that clueless as to the origin of Charle\xe2\x80\x99s voice. He should be able to just run up on him and get to blasting.  Bro, seriously, how can you not find the one guy yelling like a maniac in an empty store at night and take him down. Look at this shot, the building is not that big.  Mr. Magoo is too busy getting turned around in the tiny toy store to stop Charles from casting some voodoo spells which transfer his soul out of his dying body and into a Good Guys doll. Yah, there\xe2\x80\x99s no way Mike could have anticipated that move though.  I know this guy is a bit unhinged at the moment, but transferring your soul into a \xe2\x80\x98sterile\xe2\x80\x99, plastic doll seems like a fresh hell you would want no part of. Guess it\xe2\x80\x99s better than the witch in Friend Request having to hang herself over a bonfire in order to transfer her soul into the black mirror, computer dimension. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, which would you rather your soul be transferred into, a black mirror dimension, or a Chucky doll? Personally, I'd just take the L and go out guns blazing. The soul transference causes a massive explosion sending Mike flying ass first through the toy store.  The morning after the incident, we start following Andy on his birthday. The only thing more disturbing than his breakfast is his infatuation with the Good Guys doll. It just seems weird to me. Action figures and little green army men make sense. But a cabbage patch kids doll nearly the size of a 6 year old would, i\xe2\x80\x99d think, be creepy to a kid. I\xe2\x80\x99m just glad that nowadays you can buy a kid a tablet with an internet connection and be good. All these parents bitching about their kids being inseparable from their phones need to realize that their alternative could be a bunch of creepy dolls left all over the house that may or may not come to life and murder you.  Andy\xe2\x80\x99s mom is struggling to make ends meet, and can\xe2\x80\x99t afford the $100 price to buy him his favorite psycho doll at retail stores. Who the fuck would pay $100 for that doll. I\xe2\x80\x99d pay $100 to not have that doll in my possession. Alas, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to disappoint Andy, so to make his birthday special she resorts to buying a doll off a suspect homeless man who no doubt looted it. What\xe2\x80\x99re the odds that he snagged the one with Charles Lee Ray inside it. Actually, the explosion probably destroyed most of the other dolls, with the voodoo magic protecting the Chucky one. So fairly likely considering he\xe2\x80\x99d want to steal the one undamaged one. Now that I think of it, this is like the Turboman from hell. Andy\xe2\x80\x99s mom has to pull a second shift, so she has her friend Maggie babysit him. While babysitting, Andy tells her that Chucky wants to watch the 9 o\xe2\x80\x99clock news. Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t a six year old be smart enough to realize that something is off about this doll. Guess not. The real nightmare begins after Maggie puts Andy to bed, and then finds Chucky watching the news on Eddie Caputo\xe2\x80\x99s escape from prison.  Disconcerting, but the only reasonable explanation a sane person would conclude is that Andy put him there. She puts Chucky back, kicks up on the couch, but then she hears and sees something sneak past her out of the corner of her eye. Hmm, must have been my imagination. She then hears another noise in the hallway. As far as she\xe2\x80\x99d think, it\xe2\x80\x99s Andy staying up and playing with his stupid doll. Side note: I hate couches like that with your backside exposed, anyone can sneak up on you and slip some piano wire around your neck.  Like i\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in previous videos, following strange sounds like this is like following an evil jelly bean trail right into a trap.  At this point, i\xe2\x80\x99d yell at Andy to stop fucking around unless he wants me to get the belt out. This is a pretty common sense move. Andy would come out of his bedroom, at which point Maggie would realize that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t open the front door or make the noises in the living room. At which point she should grab Andy, leave the apartment, and call the cops because there may be an intruder. Maggie decides to tiptoe into the kitchen where a jar of flour was knocked over, and immediately lets her guard down. What? That jar didn\xe2\x80\x99t knock itself over. She then hears another noise behind some flowers. How Chucky made those noises when he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t over there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense, but Maggie falls for the setup and takes a tiny toy hammer to the face.  This is why you need a dog. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way Chucky could have snuck around and gotten the jump on her like this with a shepherd around. Also, whoever designed those windows needs to be fired. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way it\xe2\x80\x99s legal to have windows that are that fragile in place on a 10th story apartment. Karen clocks out and heads home to find cops and ambulances everywhere. She proceeds to walk straight past the crime scene tape, past all the cops, and literally walks right into the crime scene without anyone stopping her or noticing. I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure that\xe2\x80\x99s not allowed, because she could be fucking up all the evidence, but okay.  Detective Mike Norris is on the case, back on duty not a day after being involved in a fatal shootout and getting blown up in a freak toy store explosion.  He ascertains that she was hit in the face by a toy hammer from a child sized person standing on the counter, as evidenced by the footprints. Obviously Andy murdered Maggie because she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him stay up late watching cartoons and eating sugary bowls of cereal.  Sure there are footprints on the counter, but if you took a second to check the sizing of Andy\xe2\x80\x99s shoes, you\xe2\x80\x99d realize they didn\xe2\x80\x99t match. Kid was probably playing with the doll on the counter, then someone broke in thinking that nobody was home since Karen had to pull a second shift. When the intruder realized Maggie was home, a tussle occurred and Maggie got shoved out the window. Karen flips out when Mike suggests Andy was a suspect, and orders the police to clear out of her home. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s how these things work lady. I think you need to go get a hotel room for the night, while the detectives investigate the crime scene and question witnesses. Oh, you mean like a homicide detective trying to solve the murder of your friend. Yah, they\xe2\x80\x99re so pesky.  At the end of the day, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter because nobody will suspect the doll as being the murderer. There\xe2\x80\x99s not much Andy can do because Chucky will have threatened him with death if he tries anything. Karen sits Andy down to try to find out what happened. Andy says that Chucky told him his real name is Charles Lee Ray. Your son saying his doll calls himself by a infamous serial killer's name would be off putting, but it\xe2\x80\x99s possible she didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the news and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize the name. What an absolute savage. He probably should have just kept his mouth shut on that one. Karen leaves the room and tries to snoop on Andy\xe2\x80\x99s conversations with his doll. She\xe2\x80\x99s got the right idea, but her execution is flawed. The light behind her casts a shadow into the room, which betrays her presence. It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be hard to realize you\xe2\x80\x99re casting a shadow and Andy could see that you\xe2\x80\x99re still there, in which case he won\xe2\x80\x99t reveal whatever weird shit he\xe2\x80\x99s up to. It\xe2\x80\x99s like trying to spy out your window at night with the lights on behind you. I guess you can\xe2\x80\x99t expect the jewelry saleswoman at Macy\xe2\x80\x99s to be tactical.  If she was a better spy she might have been able to overhear something. Still unlikely, as Chucky would be quietly whispering to Andy. The next morning Karen drops Andy off at school, but under the threat of murder and ending up like Maggie, Andy takes Chucky to where Chucky thinks Eddie Caputo is hiding. I get that Andy is a six year old, so this strategy might not have dawned on him. But he could go along with the plan initially, grab a lighter from home, then take Chucky to a public place and set him on fire. If Chucky fought back, everyone nearby would witness a doll coming to life and help Andy destroy it. If Chucky did nothing, the doll would simply burn to ashes along with Charle\xe2\x80\x99s soul.  I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to think the Good Guys doll company is brainwashing these kids through subliminal messaging in their shows. How else could you explain Andy running into a dilapidated ghetto building that he just heard gunshots coming from, likely from the escaped fugitive Chucky told him he was trying to find, to rescue a doll that was possessed by a serial killer who murdered his babysitter and had threatened to kill him if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t do what it said. Just run home. Chucky rigs up a classic homemade gas bomb with the oven, lays another evil Jelly Bean trail of strange noises, and Eddy falls for the bait.  If there was that much gas in the building, you\xe2\x80\x99d think Eddie would have smelled it and bounced. Or at least not have kicked open the door to the kitchen and started blasting away at shadows.  Good thing Andy wised up and walked away from the dope house before it exploded. Somehow this six year old boy became the primary suspect for the murder, and with no evidence they sentence him to a psychiatric hospital. Poor Andy, he\xe2\x80\x99s just getting shit on from both sides.  Karen takes the Chucky doll back home to interrogate it. From her perspective, she\xe2\x80\x99s clearly losing her mind. Somewhat understandable given the events that have unfolded.  As tempting as it is to put the doll in the oven and crank the temp up, she\xe2\x80\x99s desperate to prove her son is innocent. Destroying the doll wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help Andy\xe2\x80\x99s case.  If she wanted to prove Andy was innocent and thought that the doll might be alive because again, she\xe2\x80\x99s losing it mentally, then why not force the doll to make a move while you were in the police station? All you\xe2\x80\x99d need to do is start ripping its legs and arms off.  Karen picks up the box Chucky came in, and the batteries fall out. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s getting creepy. She then hesitantly picks the doll up to check if there were batteries preinstalled.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not a 100% confirmation that the doll is alive, but it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty god damn close. Close enough that she should just destroy it the next chance she gets.  I would not be sticking my head under the couch like that, you\xe2\x80\x99re just asking to get a toy knife shoved in your eye. She should just flip the couch over then grab him.  Karen wises up, lights the fireplace and threatens to throw him in unless he says something.  I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what she was expecting. Of course if Chucky was real like she was trying to prove, he would be forced to fight her when she threatened him like that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she was anticipating him being that strong, but she did suspect that he murdered Maggie, which would indicate that he had some level of strength, which would mean that he might be more difficult to handle than she\xe2\x80\x99d think.  The general idea here is that you don\xe2\x80\x99t threaten to kill someone unless you\xe2\x80\x99re in a definitively advantageous position to carry out the killing. Karen wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. She shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have revealed her intentions before securing her position of power over him. Basically, she should\xe2\x80\x99ve taken him over to the kitchen to \xe2\x80\x98read the instructions on the box he came in\xe2\x80\x99 and then stuffed him in the oven. From there she could threaten him and he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to fight back.  Throwing chucky across the room was a dumb move too. The fireplace was literally right next to you, why not throw him in there if it was so easy.  Chucky\xe2\x80\x99s power comes from his ability to surprise his prey. Knowing he can\xe2\x80\x99t win a fight with her head to head, he runs off. Karen could just let the doll go, nobody will believe her and she\xe2\x80\x99s not equipped to deal with that kind of threat. She will still be able to get Andy back, because with no actual evidence condemning Andy as a murderer, they can\xe2\x80\x99t keep him locked up in a psych ward for long. Still, Chucky murdered Maggie and ruined Andy\xe2\x80\x99s life. Revenge is running through her veins. If she wants any chance at finding Chucky, she needs to find out more about Charles Lee Ray, his home, his motivations, his friends and family. She goes to the police station again, but Mike\xe2\x80\x99s no help, so she decides her next best option is to wander back alleys by herself in search of the creepy peddler who sold her the doll.  Unsurprisingly, that peddler\xe2\x80\x99s less than empathetic about her situation.  She got lucky the detective actually gave a shit about her to follow her and make sure she was safe. This movie easily could have turned into a I Spit on Your Grave crossover.  Mike reveals to her that he killed Charles Lee Ray, but that Charles had been yelling voodoo chants before getting struck by lightning. He still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe the doll is alive yet, but it\xe2\x80\x99s weird enough that he heads back to the police station to reopen the investigation.  Let\xe2\x80\x99s do some bad detective work from Mike\xe2\x80\x99s POV.  He fatally wounded Charles Lee Ray in a toy store, but before he died he was yelling voodoo chants. On a clear night sky, storm clouds rolled in above and lightning hit Charles directly. You later found him next to a Good Guys doll. You just found out that Karen bought one of those same dolls from a peddler who looted it from that same store the morning after the incident. Then that night, Karen\xe2\x80\x99s friend was murdered. The next day, Eddie Caputo, the man he swore to get back, got murdered as well. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s Mike, the other man he swore to get back at. If that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make you a bit paranoid I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what will.  On his way back to his car, Mike makes the rookie mistake of getting into his car without checking the backseat, you\xe2\x80\x99d think he would consider everything we just talked about.  Now Mike has a killer doll trying to stab his balls through the car seat while he\xe2\x80\x99s going 40 miles per hour. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way this ends well. To make matters worse, the brake pedal on his cheap piece of shit car falls off while Chucky jams the accelerator.  Mike spins the car out safely, but then stupidly straightens the wheel out which enables the car to gain lethal levels of speed again. If he just held the steering wheel cranked to the side, the car wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to gain any speed. He\xe2\x80\x99d just be doing donuts. Of course that still leaves the problem of Chucky, but without the threat of a high speed collision he can focus on fucking the doll up. This mistake made the car uncontrollable and a crash inevitable. I always hate these scenes in movies where the person is floundering in the upside down car while being attacked. Inside an upside down car is the worst position you could possibly be in. I know he just crashed and is probably disoriented, but he seems to be with it, so he should\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to crawl his ass out ASAP.  Even though he was disoriented and jacked up on adrenaline from the crash, Mike is able to land a shot on Chucky's shoulder, forcing him to flee to his voodoo doctor for help.  His voodoo teacher answers that the more time he spends in that body, the more human he becomes, and that eventually he will be stuck in that body forever if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t transfer his soul out of it soon. This is why you want to read the fine print on the voodoo rituals before using them.  Naturally Chucky wants answers as to how to transfer his soul out of the doll, but John refuses, declaring him an abomination that must be stopped.  John, John, John. Why would you reveal your intentions prematurely? You know you are dealing with a magic doll possessed by the soul of a serial killer, who you think needs to be stopped. Of course he\xe2\x80\x99s going to get pissed and attack you when you refuse to help him. You should have just gone along with trying to help him, while plotting out a way to defeat him.  He\xe2\x80\x99s right you know. Telling a serial killer the location of your personal voodoo doll was flat out idiotic. Why even have a voodoo doll like that around in the first place. That\xe2\x80\x99s like wearing a bomb vest and keeping the detonator on the counter. At least put it in a vault for christ's sake. John\xe2\x80\x99s stupidity leads to him getting tortured into telling Chucky that in order to get out of the doll, he needs to swap souls with the first person he revealed himself too, which would be Andy.  John screwed up here again. By giving Chucky the answer, he just gave up his only bargaining chip and immediately became expendable.  Karen and Mike show up just after the stabbing. John holds out long enough to mutter that he was an asshole and told Chucky to swap souls with her child. He does also mention that the only way to kill Chucky was to shoot him through the heart he was forming. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have time to fact check this, but it sounds plausible. Jesus they really put a six year old in a derelict psychiatric prison because they thought it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t healthy for a six year old to have an imaginary friend after the kid suffered immense psychological trauma from witnessing a murder. Yah this prison is definitely a healthier way to rehabilitate him than seeing a therapist 2 times a week. Andy spots Chucky coming for him, and after seeing what he\xe2\x80\x99s capable of, knows that this is bad news. He stages a classic prison escapee move by putting pillows under the sheets to fake Chucky out so he could grab the keys and run. While not guaranteed to work because he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have relied on Chucky dropping the keys, and Chucky could have entered through the window bars, it\xe2\x80\x99s still a pretty good plan, especially for a six year old. Not sure there was much else he could have done.  Andy\xe2\x80\x99s kind of screwed regardless. There\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere to run, so the psycho doctor catches him and tries to inject him with a tranquilizer. Chucky also catches up with them and gives the doctor a taste of his own electro-shock therapy.  While Chucky is getting hot and bothered watching the doctor get electrocuted to death, Andy escapes back to his home. This is such an obvious move that Chucky would anticipate. I still think going to a public location surrounded by people and pay phoning his mom would be best.  Sure enough, Chucky\xe2\x80\x99s right on his tail. Haha I just had to include that.  Andy would know by now that Chucky is actually pretty strong, and he probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t win a physical altercation against him. However, hiding in a closet is a terrible idea, because it\xe2\x80\x99s literally the first place anyone checks. Andy opts for a frontal engagement with his toy bat. Bro, why not grab a knife from the kitchen.  Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter though, Andy\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be outsmarting what is essentially a mid 30 year old serial killer that has much more experience hunting humans.  Karen and Mike better hustle their asses up or Andy\xe2\x80\x99s going to swap bodies with Chucky.  Dude just shoot the lock, that weak ass shouldering is wasting precious time.  They bust in and throw the doll across the room, then both proceed to ignore it like it isn\xe2\x80\x99t capable of murdering them. Again, stop throwing your enemies and giving them the opportunity to re engage. You especially don\xe2\x80\x99t want Chucky escaping and coming back to kill you at a later date when your guard is down. And again, stop bending down to check under the beds and making yourself vulnerable. Just flip the bed.  Who\xe2\x80\x99d have thought Karen owned a gat. She lands a solid hit on Chucky\xe2\x80\x99s leg, but her gun jams so she tosses it on the floor and runs. The gun jamming was likely caused by her limp wristing it. Common for inexperienced shooters. Basically, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t hold a stiff enough grip on the pistol frame to prevent it from traveling rearward while the slide was cycling back and forth. Thus the action couldn\xe2\x80\x99t generate enough opposing force to properly eject and seat a new round. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the time or experience to remediate it before Chucky charged again, but throwing it on the ground infront of him was incredibly stupid. Not only did you give up your only weapons which you could have run off with and cleared by pulling the mag out and cycling the action, but Chucky could have picked the pistol up, cleared the jam, and used it against you. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing Chucky\xe2\x80\x99s stupid too, because he runs past the gun to try to physically fight people way stronger than him. Karen overpowers him and this time, manages to throw him in the fireplace.  There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have tried to hold the gate shut so Chucky fully melted down and didn\xe2\x80\x99t run through your living room lighting everything on fire.  Karen and Andy both leave the doll to go check on Mike, which is a mistake. Mike only got a cut and bopped in the head with a toy bat, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fatally wounded in any way.  This serial killer doll is possessed by strong voodoo magic, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no way you can be sure it\xe2\x80\x99s dead after burning it up a bit. The only way to make sure it won\xe2\x80\x99t come back to kill you is to put it back in the fireplace and melt it down to ashes.  Karen then sends Andy to walk past the presumed dead killer doll to get the first aid kit, by himself. How about Mike gets off his ass and you all make sure Chucky is 100% dead before sending Andy off to get Mike a dora the explorer band aid.  Surprise surprise, the magic doll you crisped up a bit isn\xe2\x80\x99t dead.  Say what you want about the Good Guys company, but they sure do know how to make a durable doll.  Blowing Chucky into pieces is effective at incapacitating him, but again, she needs to vaporize the doll. It\xe2\x80\x99s obvious now that the magic and Charle\xe2\x80\x99s soul will persist until it\xe2\x80\x99s gone completely.  Mike\xe2\x80\x99s detective friend shows up, casually waltzing into the apartment after hearing all those gunshots pop off. He\xe2\x80\x99s understandably in disbelief, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like they had body cams, but he gets his introduction to Chucky\xe2\x80\x99s rage soon enough.  I still don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how a blown to pieces doll has enough strength to fight an adult human. It\xe2\x80\x99s missing an arm and a leg too, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have any leverage to hold on with. Magic voodoo, how does it even work. Karen finally remembers what the voodoo doc said. The movie ends with them leaving the scene to go to a hospital.
