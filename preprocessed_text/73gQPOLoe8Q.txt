Hey hey and hello sprayers wherever you are, welcome back to this channel. Of course, to watch great films, this time I will tell you a summary of the film entitled Beauty Salon Special Services which was released in 2016 this film tells of a woman who has a salon but  the salon was very empty of customers until finally his female cousin came up with an innovation in another to save his cousin Shalom okay let's just watch the full story the film begins by showing a woman named a child who is going to her cousin's salon. Upon arrival at the salon her cousin looks at her cousin's face  this one named supiyo is feeling very gloomy, it seems that there is a serious problem that is being faced by Sooyoung. After you asked Sukyoung about the problem, it was found that Young's consumption at that time was very low with customers.  i he also had to extend his salon contract only then said to Sooyoung that he had to make an innovation so that the salon did not go bankrupt in the middle of their conversation a man came and Sooyoung spontaneously took the man to the cashier desk to offer treatment. it turns out that the man didn't come for treatment at the salon but just wanted to ask for the address the next day when Sub was at his salon there was a man who used Mrs. services coming to Sooyoung's salon, the man turned out to be the owner of the salon building that Sukyoung rented who at that time charged supiyo salon contract renewal money but because the salon customers were very quiet at that time supiyo asked the shop owner to provide relief and he promised to immediately pay off the Shin salon contract extension money then turned to Hana who was trying to apply for a job but unfortunately  No company is willing to accept Hana so she then goes to see Sukjong at his salon and they both look very gloomy thinking about their bad luck they finally decide to go to a cafe for drinks while trying to forget the problems they face in the middle  their conversation just suddenly got the idea to work with Sooyoung to run a sukyoung salon so that the salon can Rise from adversity just have an idea to do an innovation can directly Kiong by adding a new service method that will attract more customers sukyoung gladly accept the invitation from Hana and he asked Sooyoung to come to the salon tomorrow to start the idea that he said earlier and the next day only came to the salon with a pretty sexy appearance with a pretty tight dress and really showed Sooyo's bovine curves  ung was quite surprised to see his cousin's makeup. He was also confused about what his brother would do to fix his salon at first the salon looked still quiet but at night there was a man who finally came to the salon only swiftly and immediately greeted his first customer in a friendly manner.  and slightly spiced up by the temptation of spoiled supiyo, who still doesn't know about Hana's plans, can only stay silent to see what supiyo will do to his customers, start only providing service to that customer and how surprising it turns out that he only takes off his clothes and then gives plus-plus services to the man  That was after the plus-plus service was provided by Hana. The customer seemed satisfied with the service provided and he also paid dearly for Hana's steady service earlier, this clearly made Hanna and Sooyoung happy because it seemed that Hana's crazy idea was going well, but Sooyoung persisted.  I wonder if it 's okay and Hana just tells Sooyoung to stay calm since carrying out Hana's crazy idea and the Sukim salon continues to increase until finally Sooyoung is interested in learning to serve customers the Hana way. Hana then teaches Supiyo how to serve bananas and also twin seeds of customers and the next day supiyo was ready to serve his first customer that day the tribe wore a pretty sexy dress and he was ready to serve a man named Minho so that supiyo wouldn't be awkward to do his first action just leaving Soo Kyung alone with min-  ho at the salon and Sooyoung finally did her first plus-plus service on Sunday after finishing drinking, of course, she had to pay for the service that had just been provided by Sooyoung and she was surprised after seeing the service bill that Sugeng had given because the price was very expensive but after Sooyoung came,  Go to Min-ho and tease him a little. Sunday, finally willing to pay the bill, customers after customers began to arrive, annoyed, they got recommendations from men who had been there. Hi, the income of the supiyo salon, which used to be sad, has now increased many times. Then they celebrated the success of their greetings by going to a cafe to eat and of course also drinking soju the next day Sunday they came back to the salon only and Sooyoung to get back to enjoying the fantastic service from Sooyoung, it seems this week has already been addicted to Sooyoung and Seohyun's own service with will wholeheartedly serve his loyal customers day after day their customers are increasing and this has made them both successful where Hana is now able to buy an expensive apartment and Sooyoung has been able to pay off the money for the extension of her salon contract as well as debts.  another debt one day when the salon was about to close there was a young man who came in annoyed with them for a treatment, it seems this man didn't know that the salon was a plus-plus salon and as usual this curvaceous Z2 ferociously served their last customer that day but and after the man  The man got service plus plus the man was unable to pay the bill because he only brought a little money. Obviously this made Hanna and Sooyoung angry but the man defended himself by saying that he didn't ask for treatment like that but he only came to get treatment like at a salon  -salons in general because and Sooyoung did not receive a defense from the man then they ganged up on the man until the man ran out of the salon the next day the man came back to the salon only and Sooyoung at the same time as the previous day at first only and Sooyoung looked annoyed with  the arrival of the man but after the man said that he had reported their greetings to the police only suddenly became nice to the man but the man was not tempted by Ana then he ordered the police who he had called to go inside only and Sooyoung finally  arrested by the police on charges of having opened a plus-plus salon as well as on charges of molestation committed against the man yesterday at the end of the film it was shown that Sooyoung was waiting for someone somewhere and of course the person she was waiting for was her cousin Hana they finally met again after all this time  The long time serving the men behind the dancing bars ended the film entitled Beauty Salon special service. This is okay, that's all the video from former Mantap. This time, a lesson can be taken from this film, where a business certainly needs a new innovation in order to be able to grow and develop.  That's a crazy idea that can be done and can improve the situation of our business, but in the end it will be in vain because a business that is run in a bad way will of course also end badly. who
