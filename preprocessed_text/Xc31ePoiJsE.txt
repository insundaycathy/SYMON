I am the tesseract or your brother's head. resurrections. this time there are two more stones on earth. find the my children and bring them to me on time. bring me the stem. [Music]. so me, a group will go with the pirate age. and the morons will go to nowhere to try to stop battles. I know something he doesn't. he finds it out, the entire universe could be at risk. what do you know? reality can be whatever. that's why I trusted you to find the soul stone. stone demands a sacrifice. [Music], come on, get a situation. I think I've done theirs in trouble. what's your point, Lisa, mr. Fitz not expecting it. so I say we take the fight to him. yeah. we got one advantage. he's coming to us. we'll use it. all right.

I'm gonna hold it open. that's suicide. so it was facing silence, without that axe. [Music]. [Applause]. [Music], I think you'll find our will be cool. [Music] good. where is Gomorrah? [Music] stop. spare his life and I will give you the stone. [Music], this is no place to die. [Music], there was no other way. well you. [Music]
