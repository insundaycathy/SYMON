Welcome to Movies Explained, today we're looking at the movie 7500. The story starts at Berlin airport, where people are moving around, waiting to board their planes. The camera zooms in to Vedat, who the officers are searching before boarding the plane. His various shots play where he buys sodas, sits next to a strange man, and walks around the hallways. The screen goes black, and the name of the movie, 7500, appears. The next scene is in the plane, where flight attendants and pilots are entering the plane. Michael Lutzmann takes the pilot seat while Tobias Ellis sits next to him. They are discussing the details of the airplane. Michael says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe plane is technically okay; only a tire has a small crack which you will change tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d He stands up and goes out for a while. One of the flight attendants, Gokce, comes into the cockpit and closes the door behind. She tells Tobias, \xe2\x80\x9cMy mother called and said we didn't get in the kindergarten next door.\xe2\x80\x9d Tobias says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe will find a solution; you don't have to worry.\xe2\x80\x9d He further says, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is another kindergarten which is also good but it is far away.\xe2\x80\x9d Gokce says, \xe2\x80\x9cI want Deniz to have some German kids around.\xe2\x80\x9d They talk for a while and Gokce leaves when Michael comes back in. He says to Tobias, \xe2\x80\x9cYou guys seem to know each other\xe2\x80\x9d, to which he says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe try to keep our professional and personal lives separate but can't.\xe2\x80\x9d Michael assumes that they are married, but Tobias tells him that they have a kid, Deniz, together who is currently staying at Gokce's mother, but they are not married. Mario comes in and brief Michael on the details. He leaves and says, \xe2\x80\x9cI will be down if you need me.\xe2\x80\x9d Gokce comes in and gives something to Tobias. She then asks the pilots, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you ready to board the plane?\xe2\x80\x9d Michael replies, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are born ready.\xe2\x80\x9d He asks Gokce, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere your name comes from?\xe2\x80\x9d She tells him, \xe2\x80\x9cIt comes from Turkey and my father was a Turk.\xe2\x80\x9d She leaves, and Michael starts giving a departure briefing. The flight attendants are welcoming people while Michael and Tobias talk. Tobias tells Michael upon asking that he has been for ten years and is 31. While they are talking, Mario comes in again and says, \xe2\x80\x9cI have bad news. Two passengers are missing, and both have luggage on the plane. We tried finding them but couldn't.\xe2\x80\x9d Michael says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not going to wait for them; you can unload their luggage.\xe2\x80\x9d Tobias says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe can wait if them of you want\xe2\x80\x9d, but Michael says, \xe2\x80\x9cI hate waiting\xe2\x80\x9d. Tobias is checking his phone when Michael points out two people coming towards the plane. They are the missing passengers which the pilots recognize. Mario contacts the cockpit and says two people are coming your way. He also informs Michael that he didn't unload the luggage yet. He signs off by saying that I will come up to you with the loading papers in a while. Michael speaks with the passengers and welcomes them to the flight to Paris. He tells them that the boarding is complete and the plane will leave on time. He explains that Tobias Ellis will fly them today, and they will contact the passengers with more information during the flight. Tobias says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are ready for the flight.\xe2\x80\x9d They go over the pre-flight checks when Nathalia comes in and asks the pilots, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you want to have in your meals.\xe2\x80\x9d Tobias chooses sandwich and water while Michael asks for only non-carbonates water. She leaves, and after completing all the checks, they take off. They contact European 162 and go over the details of the track and weather etc. Michael informs people about the turbulence and asks them to fasten their seatbelts for their safety. Michael tells him that tomorrow's weather doesn't look so bad, to which Tobias replies, \xe2\x80\x9cI haven't checked it out yet.\xe2\x80\x9d Nathalia comes in with the food in the cockpit when several men attack from behind, trying to control the cockpit. Both the pilots are shot and are wounded. Tobias makes an effort to keep one of the attackers out and closes the door to the cockpit while Michael struggles with the other attacker. While trying to get the hijacker named Kinan off him, he sets the plane off the trajectory. Tobias gets up and renders Kinan unconscious with a fire extinguisher. Michael tells him to press the nose, which he does and keeps the plane on track. Various noises are coming into the cockpit of the hijackers trying to spread chaos in the people. Tobias contacts European 162 and tells them they have an emergency. European 162 asks, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the problem?\xe2\x80\x9d, and he says, \xe2\x80\x9c7500.\xe2\x80\x9d Tobias tells the man on the radio that the plane is hijacked and the pilot is injured. The attackers tried to storm into the cockpit, but they have stopped them for now and have complete control of the plane. The man on the radio asks about the status of the flight attendants, to which Tobias says, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not aware.\xe2\x80\x9d He goes into the details when Kinan starts to gain consciousness. Tobias leaves his seat and beats him with his feet, and ties his hands with tape. He tells Michael to keep the pressure on the wound and talk to him while Tobias ties Kinan with a belt. Tobias comes back to his seat and asks Michael how Michael is doing. He comes in contact with European 162 and says, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to make a landing in Berlin\xe2\x80\x9d, to which the man replies, \xe2\x80\x9cIt will take 30 minutes, so you have to make your landing to Hanover, which is the nearest.\xe2\x80\x9d Tobias confirms the location, and the man tells him, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have informed Hanover of an emergency landing and are making the necessary preparations.\xe2\x80\x9d Upon further asking, Tobias tells the European 162 that one of the flight attendants is dead while he hopes others are safe. The man on the radio asks, \xe2\x80\x9cHow many hijackers are there and how they are armed?\xe2\x80\x9d Tobias says, \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen the four of them, but there may be more at the back of the plane. I didn't see any weapons except broken glass, which they are using as knives.\xe2\x80\x9d Tobias signs off from the radio to take care of his wound. He wraps a bandage around his wounded arm to stop the bleeding and comes back to his seat. Tobias asks Michael how he is doing, but this time gets no reply. He tries to get him off the seat and at last succeeds. Ellis tries giving him compressions and breathe but receives no response. He comes back to the seat and tells European 162 that the captain is dead. The man informs him that landing at Hanover is ready, and two Eurofighter are heading your way. He takes the phone and starts talking to the people. He says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have complete control of the plane. Several men tried to storm in the cockpit, but we prevented it. We will be making an emergency landing in 20 minutes in Hanover. Stay calm and fasten your seat belts.\xe2\x80\x9d He looks at the screen and sees the attackers threatening to kill one of the hostages. He connects to European 162 and tells them that hijackers threaten to kill a hostage if they don't open the door. The man says, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know you can\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x9d He takes the phone and talks to the hijackers. They start talking to him in German, to which he says, \xe2\x80\x9cI am American so please say whatever you are saying in English.\xe2\x80\x9d Vedat asks Tobias where Kinan is. He shouts and yells and says that you can't land the plane. If you land it, we will kill the boy. Tobias replies, \xe2\x80\x9cI can't open the door you have to get away from the boy.\xe2\x80\x9d The hijacker's named Vedat and Daniel keep saying that you have to open the door or kill the boy. The hijackers start counting from 10 and say, you have 10 seconds, or the boy will die\xe2\x80\x94Tobias answers I cannot do anything. I am sorry and turns off the screen. The banging continues on the door while Tobias goes over the landing details. He turns the screen on and finds the hostage dead. The man from European 162 comes on the radio with the updates of the landing. Tobias tells him that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t open the door, and the hijackers killed the boy. The man tells him that the fighter jets will be around him in two minutes. Tobias takes the phone and says to the hijackers, \xe2\x80\x9cI have talked to the authorities, and they are saying when we land and refuel, you can go anywhere you like and negotiate your terms. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough fuel, so we have to land.\xe2\x80\x9d Vedat and Daniel keep saying that we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to land; you will see all these people die if you do. Daniel goes into the cabin and brings Gokce with him. Tobias becomes overwhelmed and begs the hijackers to let the woman go. He says, \xe2\x80\x9cI will kill Kinan if you do not let her go.\xe2\x80\x9d Left with no choice, Tobias picks up the phone and addresses the people. He says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe hijackers will kill a young woman in front of the plane. You can stop them. The hijackers don\xe2\x80\x99t have any guns; they have broken glass. They are going to kill her. If you work together, you can overpower the hijackers and kill them.\xe2\x80\x9d He begs them to come forward and save Gokce. Vedat asks Tobias over the phone, that why are you not opening the door? Daniel is going to kill everyone. Tobias tries to talk to Vedat when Daniel leaves. Tobias says to Vedat, \xe2\x80\x9cI know you are not like him; you can stop him. You are better than him.\xe2\x80\x9d Vedat says, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d, but Tobias keeps on telling him that he can and he should. He begs him and cries for his help. Daniel brings Gokce in front of the camera while she begs him not to kill her. She keeps on repeating that she has a son, let me go. Tobias tells the people to fasten their seatbelts Vedat tries to fight Daniel, but he fails. After going through all the possibilities, Tobias agrees to open the door to the cockpit, but Gokce says, \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t have to listen to them.\xe2\x80\x9d The hijackers keep on threatening her while she says her last words to Tobias. She tells Tobias to take care of their son Deniz. Daniel kills Gokce at last. Tobias is devastated by this, and he screams and shouts while hitting different things in the cockpit. The radio calls Tobias many times, and so he comes in and reports to European 162. The German defense department speaks with him and tells him that we will escort him to Hanover, follow us. Meanwhile, Kinan wakes up and sets himself free. Kinan hits Tobias, and he becomes unconscious. Kinan opens the cockpit door and lets Vedat in while the passengers attack the other hijackers. Kinan clears his intentions of crashing the plane, which makes Vedat scared. The fear of death makes Vedat strike Kinan with the broken glass, which kills him after a brief fight. Tobias says Vedat to set him free and let him take control of the plane. Vedat helps Tobias stabilize the plan. Tobias connects with European 162 and updates them on the situation. He says, I have gained control of the plane. One of the hijackers is dead while the other one is here with me.\xe2\x80\x9d The man on the radio says, "I want to confirm that you are ready for the emergency landing.\xe2\x80\x9d Tobias says, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course, I am.\xe2\x80\x9d Vedat panics and says, \xe2\x80\x9cYou can't land; you have to drop me somewhere else.\xe2\x80\x9d Tobias repeats what he said before, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are out of fuel. Once we refuel, you can go anywhere you like.\xe2\x80\x9d Tobias confirms the landing to the man on the radio. He says Vedat to sit down and fasten his seat belt as the landing will not be smooth. He says to Vedat, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to inform the passengers if that is okay with you.\xe2\x80\x9d Vedat permits him, and Tobias speaks to the passengers. He says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe hijackers have taken control of the plane, but they have agreed to an emergency landing. Stay calm and tighten your belts because the landing will not be a smooth one.\xe2\x80\x9d Vedat looks around and finds the jets and asks Tobias what that, to which he replies it is just the standard protocol is. Tobias gives some instructions to Vedat to follow as they make the landing. Vedat helps him to coordinate the landing, and finally, the plane lands. The police are surrounding the parameter. The man from the radio says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe police will talk to you on this frequency.\xe2\x80\x9d Vedat becomes scared and starts crying. He questions Tobias about what he is doing. Tobias tells him that I have opened the emergency exit if you want to go. Vedat tells him to come and sit on the floor next to Kinan\xe2\x80\x99s body. Vedat points to the radio and says, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I talk to the man speaking.\xe2\x80\x9d Tobias tells him to use the microphone on the left side and push the button. Vedat talks to the negotiator and asks him for fuel. He becomes aggressive and emotionally unstable, realizing what he has just done. Vedat sits close to Tobias and starts talking to him. He asks his name, where does he lives, and talks about the part in Wilhelmstrasse. Tobias tells him that I go there often with my son Deniz. Vedat asks Tobias about the unique name of his son, to which Tobias replies, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is Turkish and he got it from her mother, who is from Turkey.\xe2\x80\x9d Vedat asks, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened to his mother\xe2\x80\x9d, and Tobias thinks of striking him with the hidden glass but he stops. Vedat loses control once again and starts yelling at Tobias. Tobias tries to talk to him and asks him his age. Vedat says, \xe2\x80\x9cI am just 18.\xe2\x80\x9d Vedat checks the news and finds everyone talking about the hijacking. He becomes angry at Tobias and says, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do?\xe2\x80\x9d. The negotiator on the outside tells him not to move. Finally, the police take a shot at Vedat and strike him down. They rescue Tobias while he keeps on asking for a doctor for Vedat. The officer enters and takes people out. The story ends with Tobias moving past Gokce's body while Vedat\xe2\x80\x99s phone rings on the floor.
