hello. this is definition. and yes, I have absolutely no idea which baseball team is on the hat that I wear. Cheers. in my never-ending quest to collect junk, I decided to get another one of these boxes. this time it's the Superman DC. legion of collectors one. so let's unbox it and see what it's in. as you can see, I love a bloody long Superman. open it up. I can see the patches out. it's been opened. patches there. they can go on the wall. I collect all these on my wall, you see. so quite happy with that. put a nerdgasm in over here. you see lights because it's a combination of supermen and supermen. the Funko pop. so really happy with that t-shirt. absolutely love that. next is a little Superman keyring. I've got a Batman one of me keys. so quite happy with that. got a limited edition Superman Funko pop. I'm quite happy with that one. I've got other Superman Funko pops. you can see them over there. I don't even want to look at them anymore because I've got this piece of junk instead. this is the favorite thing I've ever really liked this one. we've got an Action Comics that can go me more as well. Harley Quinn in that and Ted Joker was, I've got a Superman number one Barry and comic, which, yeah, I'm quite happy with. I collect a lot of fun ghosts. and so, yeah, quite happy with that. it's very fungal theme this week, so loads of cool little things if you're 15 years old. to be honest, I think even a 15 year old wouldn't collect these things, but I enjoy them. thanks very much for checking out my unboxing review. there'll be another one coming soon. so take care.
