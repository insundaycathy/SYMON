Halloween Kills is finally coming to theaters and it's a sequel to both the 1978 original Halloween and the 2018 Halloween of the same name. So if you need a quick recap of everything that happened in Halloween 1978 and Halloween 2018 to get you prepared for Halloween Kills, well then don't worry, this video has you covered. This is everything you need to know before seeing Halloween Kills. The original Halloween from 1978 starts back in 1963 when a six year old Michael Myers stabs his older sister to death after she has sex with her boyfriend. Cut to 1978 and an adult Michael Myers has broken out of Smith\xe2\x80\x99s Grove Sanitarium, just as his psychiatrist Dr. Samuel Loomis and Loomis\xe2\x80\x99 assistant, Marion Chambers, arrive to transport him to a court hearing that would potentially keep Michael locked up for good. On Michael\xe2\x80\x99s way to his hometown of Haddonfield, he kills a mechanic and steals his signature coveralls, and steals his infamous mask and knives from a hardware store. As Michael\xe2\x80\x99s psychiatrist Dr. Samuel Loomis teams up with Sheriff Brackett to hunt him down to lock back up forever, Michael begins stalking high school student Laurie Strode after seeing her at his childhood home. On Halloween night, Laurie is babysitting Tommy Doyle, a young outcast picked on by other kids at school, like the bully Lonnie Elam. Across the street, Laurie\xe2\x80\x99s friend Annie, the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, babysits Lindsay Wallace. Eventually, Annie drops Lindsay off with Laurie so she can go have sex with her boyfriend Paul. Annnnd that\xe2\x80\x99s when Michael kills Annie. Later that night, Laurie and Annie\xe2\x80\x99s friend Lynda and her boyfriend Bob arrive at the Wallace house and, after finding it empty, decide to have sex. Annnnd that\xe2\x80\x99s when Michael shows up and kills them too. Moral of the story? Never have sex in the general vicinity of Michael Myers. Eventually, Laurie goes over to the Wallace house to investigate and finds the bodies of her friends, and is then chased by Michael back over to the Doyle house. Laurie helps Tommy and Lindsay escape to call the police for help, and then begins her violent confrontation with Michael Myers. Laurie manages to stab Michael multiple times before Dr. Loomis finally arrives to finish him off with some gunshots to the chest. Michael appears to fall off the balcony to his death, but when Loomis and Laurie go to check, they discover that Michael Myers has disappeared. The story continues in the 2018 version of Halloween, where Michael Myers has been re-institutionalized at Smith\xe2\x80\x99s Grove for the past 40 years. After an attempted interview by two true crime podcasters, Michael manages to escape and tracks the podcasters, killing them and stealing back his infamous mask before once again heading back to Haddonfield. In the 40 years since her encounter with Michael Myers, Laurie is still living in intense fear. She lives in seclusion in a heavily fortified house and has little relationship with her adult daughter, Karen, who the state took from Laurie\xe2\x80\x99s care when she was 12. Her only real human connection is her teenage granddaughter, Allyson. Upon hearing that Michael has escaped, Deputy Frank Hawkins, who we learn is the officer that arrested Michael in 1978 after his confrontation with Laurie, tries to warn Sheriff Barker about the killer\xe2\x80\x99s imminent return, but the sheriff brushes him off. When Laurie hears of Michael\xe2\x80\x99s escape, she tries to warn her daughter, Karen, but is similarly brushed off. At a Halloween night costume party, Allyson discovers that her boyfriend Cameron, son of the original film\xe2\x80\x99s school bully Lonnie, is cheating on her. Hurt, Allyson leaves the party with Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s friend Oscar. Meanwhile, Allyson\xe2\x80\x99s best friend Vicky and her boyfriend Dave are attacked and killed by Michael while babysitting a young boy named Julian. Laurie and Hawkins are separately on Michael\xe2\x80\x99s trail, and Laurie\xe2\x80\x99s first confrontation with the killer in 40 years ends with her shooting Myers in the shoulder before he can escape. Walking home from the party, Allyson and Oscar are attacked by Michael. Oscar is killed, but Allyson is saved by Hawkins and Michael\xe2\x80\x99s newest psychiatrist Dr. Sartain. Hawkins tries to kill Michael, but Sartain attacks him and leaves him for dead, revealing that he\xe2\x80\x99s become obsessed with Michael and helped orchestrate his escape to study him in the wild. This immediately backfires on Sartain, who is swiftly killed by Michael. During this chaos, Allyson manages to flee from the scene. Laurie, Karen, and Karen\xe2\x80\x99s husband Ray all arrive at Laurie\xe2\x80\x99s fortified home to protect themselves. When Michael arrives at the house in a stolen cop car, Ray goes outside to speak with who he thinks are the police. Michael reveals himself and strangles Ray to death. Laurie makes sure Karen is tucked away safely and then prepares for her showdown with Michael Myers. They trade blows, and Michael ends up stabbing Laurie and pushing her over a balcony. When Michael looks down at her body, he sees that it\xe2\x80\x99s missing. A nice reversal of the ending of the original film! When Allyson arrives at Laurie\xe2\x80\x99s home, the three generations of Strode women team up to fight Michael, shooting him and locking him up in the basement before setting the entire house ablaze. As Karen and Allyson rush a stabbed Laurie to the hospital, the Strode house continues to burn with a still breathing Michael trapped inside.
