\xef\xbb\xbfIf you made every wrong decision possible when a hurricane was hitting your home, what would you do? In this How to Beat video, we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow the Kellers, see if we can make better decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat the ALLIGATORS in, CRAWL. If you think you have a better way, let me know in the comments! If you like these how to beat videos, consider liking and subscribing. We start out following Haley, competing at a swim meet in Florida. Oh man, I know what this is. They are showing us that she\xe2\x80\x99s a competitive swimmer as a form of narrative framing in an attempt to make it somewhat believable when she inevitably outswims an alligator later in the movie. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to fool me.  All you need to do is take 5 seconds to Google, \xe2\x80\x9cHow fast can alligators swim\xe2\x80\x9d, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll come up with 20 miles per hour on average. To put how fucked she would be in perspective, Michael Phelps peaks at a meager 6 miles per hour. Good luck outswimming something over 3 times as fast as Michael Phelps. That\xe2\x80\x99s like you trying to outswim another human sprinting on land. Not going to happen. Alligators are not to be underestimated on land either. They may seem like slow and lethargic beasts that just float around in the water, but when they decide to strike they can be shockingly quick. Humans can run about 20 miles per hour on average, and a gator can only manage half that for very short distances. But. They are dangerous because they have ludicrous mode levels of acceleration and can get up to that 10 miles per hour in the blink of an eye. They\xe2\x80\x99re ambush predators afterall. Basically, if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t paying attention to an alligator that\xe2\x80\x99s 20 or 30 feet away, it\xe2\x80\x99ll probably catch you. There are videos of alligators catching cheetahs. One of the fastest animals on the planet. Cheetahs can go 0-60 in 3 seconds. If they can\xe2\x80\x99t get away I don\xe2\x80\x99t think your average American stands a chance. Oh and to top it all off, they can climb trees and fences too.  Why are we even suggesting or considering that Haley could outswim a gator when she can\xe2\x80\x99t even beat other people. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure this arrogance will fuel some bad decision making. Look i\xe2\x80\x99m not saying we aren\xe2\x80\x99t at the top of the food chain, but nature can be a merciless vicious bitch if you swim outside of your lane.  Back in the locker room Haley just now realizes that a category 5 hurricane is about to hit them, and mandatory evacuations are underway. Category 5 hurricanes can have winds exceeding 175 miles per hour and storm surges above 20 feet. Houses get ripped off their foundations and float down the street at these levels, and you just now heard about it and shrugged it off like it was just a light tropical storm passing through? Haley was probably too distracted playing Raid: Shadow Legends to realize that the hurricane\xe2\x80\x99s path shifted towards her. You too, can get dangerously immersed in Raid, exploring millions of Champion combinations and mastering countless tactics as you take on raid bosses, dungeon runs, campaign battles, and PvP Arena matches.  There are 16 different factions, such as Orcs, High Elves, Dark elves, Dwarves, and each faction has many unique champions. With over 500 champions total, you can build your team, develop your Champions, and Raid until your power goes and you realize everyone in your town was evacuated.  It\xe2\x80\x99s free to play on both mobile and PC, so use my link in the description to download it.  Later in the movie I theorize that these Crawl alligators were being bred for intelligence and aggression. They are basically the precursors to Broadmaw and Gator from The Lizardmen faction. These behemoths evolved to walk on their hind legs and use weapons and armor. Haley and Dave are lucky their gators haven\xe2\x80\x99t evolved into these bio-tanks yet.  Raid recently released its biggest ever update, the Doom Tower. It\xe2\x80\x99s a giant tower with 120 floors, a bunch of Secret Challenge Rooms, and 12 badass Bosses to take on.  There\xe2\x80\x99s a bunch of new Champions and events coming this month, including special Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day events, so now\xe2\x80\x99s a great time to get started.

But only if you\xe2\x80\x99re a new player and only for the next 30 days.  All this treasure will be waiting for you here. Good luck, you probably will need it.  On one hand it\xe2\x80\x99s tempting to be super critical of her for being so careless and nonchalant, on the other hand, I ignore tornado warnings because come on, what are the chances it actually hits me.. But, back on the first hand, hurricanes are arguably far more dangerous. A tornado is likely just going to destroy a mobile home park in bumfuck Missouri, whereas a hurricane will wipe out entire regions of coastline states. I\xe2\x80\x99d say she has a lot more reason to be worried than I ever do.  In U.S. history, the worst Hurricane caused 10 times the damage that the worst tornado did. Oh, and she lives in Florida where alligators eat people, so yah, I feel justified and in no way a hypocrite for condemning Haley whilst habitually ignoring natural disasters myself.  A rogue wave from the hurricane hasn\xe2\x80\x99t even broken through, and they are already losing track of each other. From what I cared to overhear on their phone call, the family is fractured from divorce and animosity. They\xe2\x80\x99re all somewhat repulsed by each other, yet simultaneously share a strong tether of kinship. Their relationships with each other are all very complicated and stupid. Which is why Haley hopped into her jeep to hunt down her dad that she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t talked to in forever, because he went no contact on her sister.  That\xe2\x80\x99s only when it\xe2\x80\x99s a Sharknado. Haley gets held up at a blockade where they\xe2\x80\x99re telling everyone to turn around because the Hurricane is heading straight towards them. It\xe2\x80\x99s already getting pretty bad out by now. It\xe2\x80\x99s tempting to head back but she looks at her phone. Her dad\xe2\x80\x99s face on it pulling her heartstrings. She can\xe2\x80\x99t leave, not without him.  With the confidence a jeep instills, and her above average swimming capabilities, she boldly decides to go head on into the mouth of the hurricane to find him.  Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he board up his home? It\xe2\x80\x99s common practice and this guy is a home contractor. Though it might be asking too much from him considering he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand how to operate a phone or read the news. This family screwed up on a bunch of things way earlier on. Florida is one of the most hurricane-prone places you could live, they definitely should have had a plan in place already.  Usually you have days of notice before a hurricane hits unless your head is in the ground, so there should be plenty of time to do what you need to do and get out in time. The Kellers have money and transportation, so there is no reason they should be staying instead of evacuating.  They should have checked in on each other, in person if necessary, before the hurricane showed up. This last minute, oh a hurricane is making landfall and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where my dad is, shit is.. Probably more realistic than i\xe2\x80\x99d like to admit.  After getting a proper headcount they should have made sure that their valuables and important documents are either collected or stored in bolted down waterproof containers, preferably in the attic. Their cars are stocked up with emergency supplies, have gas and are in good shape. Their electricity and gas to the house are shut off so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t flood and burn down at the same time, which would really suck. As well as storm shutters installed over the windows with any weak points reinforced.  But most importantly, they need to have firearms or chainsaws on hand just in case sharks start taking flight in the 150 mile and hour winds..  In all seriousness, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sharks swimming in the floodwaters be a big problem? Florida does have a lot of sharks on it\xe2\x80\x99s coast which attack and eat the occasional person who swims out too far. Turns out, not really. Sharks have an organ called the lateral line that can sense pressure changes indicative of impending hurricanes. When they sense these pressure changes they swim to deeper water to avoid getting washed ashore into some retiree\xe2\x80\x99s beachside pool or stuck flapping on the highway when the tide pulls out. Well what about the 1.3 million alligators that live all throughout Florida? Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t this have potential to form a gator-nado, or a gator-iccane, gator-cane? Again, not really. Attacks in Florida are very rare, with 24 confirmed fatal alligator attacks since 1973. I'd bet most of those deaths were caused by idiots trying to feed or take up-close pictures of them.  Despite their walnut sized brain, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t stupid when it comes to weathering storms either. Like sharks, they detect the pressure changes of an impending hurricane and hunker down in their natural habitats. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they can\xe2\x80\x99t end up in your backyard due to massive flooding though. Or find them in your dining room.  These sorts of situations are statistically rare enough that it\xe2\x80\x99d be reasonable for Haley to not really expect a similar encounter. Still, having firearms for defense during natural disaster situations isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad idea. Besides potential encounters with predatory wildlife, there are lots of opportunists and criminals that would take advantage of the chaos. Never hurts to have some big iron on your hip. No sign of him at the condo, his truck is gone too so he must be out somewhere else. Unless this dude is a complete psychopath, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just leave Sugar behind. She could wait for him to come back, but the lack of storm shutters and emergency supplies, the unanswered calls, the half drunk bottle of bourbon on the table, all suggest this dude got snapped up. If he was going to get supplies, he should have done it days ago.  Knowing about their other house from the divorce, it\xe2\x80\x99s likely he would be there doing something. He sure as hell isn\xe2\x80\x99t on the job right now. Haley should leave a note, grab Sugar, and head to their old house immediately while sending Beth an update. Or she could instead take a stroll down memory lane and reminisce about a time when she actually won swim competitions and had a strong loving father-daughter relationship. Did she all of the sudden forget that a category five hurricane is about to rain hell on them and that her dad is potentially in a life-threatening condition? No, shit. It\xe2\x80\x99s because everyone evacuated, because there\xe2\x80\x99s a hurricane. Finally she wises up and heads to their old house leftover from the divorce. At least Haley is providing text updates. If something bad happens to her, which is increasingly likely with the cat 5 hurricane arriving in force by now, Beth will at least have a last known location she can send to rescuers once the storm passes.  His truck \xe2\x80\x98is\xe2\x80\x99 here, which is a good sign because we know he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get swept into a flooded ravine while trying to escape. If that was the case, well, there would be no finding him and with how ferocious these alligators are he would certainly be dead meat.  None of these people bothered to board up the windows or even shut the doors to their house either. What are they even doing? There\xe2\x80\x99s no sign of her dad so far. Haley calls his phone one more time, and not only is the ringtone volume on, but it has cell service, received multiple messages from concerned family members, and had evacuation alerts. If only he put his phone in his pocket.  Speaking of, why do older folks not keep their phone on them most of the time? Your phone is about as useful as a rock if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have it on you. Yah yah, they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel the need to be connected at all times like an addicted millennial would, but at least keep it on you during a fucking natural disaster. Haley\xe2\x80\x99s investigation continues, as she spots a bunch of tools next to the sink. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me he was doing some last minute plumbing. Could the screenwriters really not think of a better reason he\xe2\x80\x99d be missing and unconscious.  That\xe2\x80\x99s why you board up the windows, in case you were wondering. And the garage door is up too. Does Barry not understand the concept of shutting doors?  Like a good doggo, Sugar alerts Haley to the crawl space entrance. As stupid as it seems, all clues are pointing to him being down there. With the mud, dead animals, debris, and god knows what else down there, I\xe2\x80\x99d think taking a minute to put some gloves, proper pants and shoes on would be wise. I gotta believe she still has some old clothes here. Or you could just go for it in capris and sandals. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s your dad and all, but if he really is down here, he\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a candidate for a Darwin award. At some point you just have to cut the dead weight off, like his wife did when she divorced him.  Haley keeps trudging onwards, stumbling into more clues which eventually lead her to Barry lying in the mud unconscious. I was really holding out for there being some legitimate reason he\xe2\x80\x99s down here. Or that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t down here in the first place but the gator dragged him down here. Nope. It\xe2\x80\x99s now confirmed. Barry Pepper, during a category 5 hurricane, was in the crawl space of a house nobody lives in, trying to fix the plumbing for a sink nobody uses. I have. No words. I think we could probably wrap this video up and say that we could have beaten the gators in crawl by not being total fucking idiots. But let\xe2\x80\x99s just continue as if Barry was doing everything correctly, but somehow he was knocked unconscious by a flying 2x4 and dragged by a gator under the crawl space to feed on him later, where Haley with her supreme detective work finds him.  The most obvious animal that would cause a bite wound like that is an alligator, considering the size of the bite and.. all the gator signs around their home.  While alligators aren\xe2\x80\x99t known to attack unprovoked or prey upon humans, it can still happen if they feel threatened or you enter their nest. Some alligators may have been washed up to their house and found a new home in the crawl space. Barry crawling into their nest probably both threatened and startled them so they attacked. Some sources say that alligators are more scared of humans than we are of them, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why human attacks are rare. I\xe2\x80\x99m calling BS on that. I\xe2\x80\x99m definitely more scared of them which is why I stay way out of their reach. These things attack lions. And they\xe2\x80\x99re scared of us. Yah, okay bro.  They don\xe2\x80\x99t fuck around when you\xe2\x80\x99re in their territory. Just go on YouTube or LiveLeak and type in alligator attacks. I still remember that story of a 2 year old getting snatched and killed by an alligator at a Disney resort in Florida. The dad attacked the alligator but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop the alligator from dragging his son into the lagoon. Truly horrific.  While alligators are a serious threat, the bigger issue is Barry\xe2\x80\x99s current condition worsening.  Haley did a good job by checking for a pulse and listening for breathing, and luckily he\xe2\x80\x99s got both because emergency services won\xe2\x80\x99t be responding. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a national guard commercial, no gung-ho 20 year old is going to rappel out of a blackhawk helicopter in the nick of time just for you.  First thing she should do is thoroughly check the bite wound to ensure that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have severe bleeding. An adult male will die if they lose half a gallon of blood. Pulse and respiration are worthless if he\xe2\x80\x99s going to bleed out in 5 to 10 minutes. Barry doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be hemorrhaging. Onto the next potential problem.  If the bacterial infection caused by all the rotting flesh in the gator\xe2\x80\x99s mouth causes septic shock, which it seems to be doing. If he loses 15-20% of his blood. If his neck, head, chest wall or lungs got injured. If he had fluid build up in his lungs. Or if anything else happens that seizes up his respiration and heart rate, he\xe2\x80\x99s in deep shit.  If his breathing stopped, she\xe2\x80\x99d have to drag him out of there and drive through the low flood waters to the nearest operational hospital while giving him a rescue breath every 5 to 6 seconds. Even 5 to 10 minutes without oxygen to the brain can cause serious and irreversible brain damage. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Haley could effectively do this. At minimum, Barry would have brain damage, but most likely would be dead. If his pulse stopped too, doing all that \xe2\x80\x98and\xe2\x80\x99 having to give chest compressions is just not going to be possible. Barry would 100% be dead. While it looked like the house was situated on a bit of a hill, this hurricane is just kicking off so flood waters could quickly rise above it and drown him if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get him to high ground. But that\xe2\x80\x99s just part of the problem. If the floodwaters reach 3 feet or higher, she won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to make the drive to a hospital without getting lifted and swept away. That is, unless you got the keys to one of these bad boys.  To state the obvious, she needs to get him out of there ASAP. Which is a lot easier said than done. She needs to be weary of his injuries and not just yank him which could worsen the situation.  As an ex-volunteer firefighter who\xe2\x80\x99s practiced rescue carries and drags, manually dragging a lifeless human that weighs 50 more pounds than you through debris-filled mud in a confined space where you can\xe2\x80\x99t stand up at all is very difficult. And she\xe2\x80\x99s barefooted with muddy hands. Again, maybe slippers weren\xe2\x80\x99t the best choice when trying to rescue your dad in a hurricane.  Since he\xe2\x80\x99s breathing and has a pulse, the absolute best thing she could do is help him regain consciousness. He probably passed out due to the pain of his collar bone being snapped like a wishbone, the emotional stress of the attack, loss of blood, dehydration, and possibly septic shock depending on how long it\xe2\x80\x99s been since the attack.  Haley should loosen any constrictive clothing, lift his legs above his heart level to aid in blood circulation, and get him some water. Rain water, not that sewage flowing in. They say not to shake and slap someone that passed out, but I think Barry\xe2\x80\x99s an exception.  He \xe2\x80\x98should\xe2\x80\x99 regain consciousness and can then crawl his own dumbass out of there.  If that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, finding a tarp to put him on will reduce the friction and make dragging him substantially easier. Which she conveniently has nearby. Good thinking Haley.  Welp ladies and gents, I think we did it. I think we successfully saved Barry Pepper from drowning and getting eaten by alligators. Just a few more steps and we can get him in the car and take him to a hospital where he can get sewed up, take some antibiotics and be good as new.  Oh come on. An alligator isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to bust through a wooden staircase like the kool aid man. Haley is lucky this alligator already has a belly full of human meat, because they can move way faster than that. Remember, these things can pounce cheetahs. Haley trying to pull 180 pounds of dead weight in the mud with her bare hands and feet is a joke.  If she can\xe2\x80\x99t run, literally, what options does she have? What should anyone do when confronted by an alligator like this. Well, basically what she did, as futile as it would be.  Unloading a Benelli M4 full of slugs into its face is your best bet. Crawling away as quickly as possible is your second best bet. You can\xe2\x80\x99t puff your chest out, make loud noises, or play dead with gators. Your only chance to survive is to fight back before it catches you and starts death rolling you, and the only weakness you can realistically exploit is gouging it\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. The problem with this strat, is that it\xe2\x80\x99s eyes are located behind it\xe2\x80\x99s giant pissed off mouth. I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to think the internet is bullshitting us about how to defend against an alligator attack. If you, a tuk tuk driver making an oil delivery.. For some reason just go with me here, rounded the corner of a backstreet and were confronted with an American Abrams tank, according to the internet, you should try to board it and spray paint it\xe2\x80\x99s optics while it\xe2\x80\x99s trying to crush you under it\xe2\x80\x99s treads. Unless you\xe2\x80\x99re Dominic Toretto, that ain\xe2\x80\x99t happenin. Yah let me juke it\xe2\x80\x99s business end, baseball slide up next to it, board the prehistoric monster like a fucking bull rider, thumb it\xe2\x80\x99s eyeballs before it rolls it\xe2\x80\x99s 800 pounds of weight onto you, then dismount the writhing pissed off beast without its tail sweeping your legs and shattering them into a hundred pieces. What could possibly go wrong.  Then again, They don\xe2\x80\x99t really have any other options.  If it did explode towards them and bite down on his legs with it\xe2\x80\x99s 3000 pounds per square inch of jaw strength, it will crush his femurs and it\xe2\x80\x99s inch and a half to 2 inch long teeth will sink deep into his flesh, enough to potentially sever arteries. If that didn\xe2\x80\x99t wake him up, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what would. With that kind of jaw strength, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to pry it\xe2\x80\x99s mouth open and get free. If there\xe2\x80\x99s water nearby it\xe2\x80\x99ll immediately drag him into it and death roll him until he drowns. If there\xe2\x80\x99s no water nearby, it\xe2\x80\x99ll just roll him on the ground until he dies..  Once a gator starts death rolling you, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much over. It is called death rolling for a reason. It disorients you, knocks the air out of you, breaks your bones, rips your limbs off, and the power and speed of the thrashing makes it near impossible to use whatever non-ripped off limbs you have left to fight back. This would all happen in a few seconds. The gator would then take his lifeless body back to it\xe2\x80\x99s den where it would wait for his corpse to start rotting before tearing pieces off to eat. Gator don\xe2\x80\x99t play no shit.  With no Benelli on hand, I think she should just drop her dad and use him as a tasty distraction so she can escape with Sugar. Haley\xe2\x80\x99s much more merciful than I am, summons some adrenaline strength and starts hauling Barry back the way she came.  Her wardrobe continues to malfunction, and her phone falls out of her capri pants fashionably small pockets. She really didn\xe2\x80\x99t think this outfit through.  This dude even had a radio telling him a hurricane was coming while he was plumbing in the crawl space. Jesus christ. Haley pulls Barry back to where she found him, which was conveniently blocked off just enough for them to get through but not the gator. I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised she remembered how to get back in this maze of crawl space with a gator snapping at her dad's feet. The gator isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only thing they need to worry about, that hurricane that nobody seems to give a shit about is picking up.  Dave, yah i\xe2\x80\x99ll start using his real name now, is just now regaining consciousness, \xe2\x80\x98after\xe2\x80\x99 pulling him out of the gators jaws. Good timing bro. Take your time.  Soaking the jacket to get him some water is pretty clever. Haley is scoring about a 7/10 right now. I had to knock some points off for the slippers and capris, but she\xe2\x80\x99s been pretty resourceful. Must have gotten more of her mothers genetics.  Of course he would say something like that, being a dumbass is perfectly on brand. He then says, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s happening with this storm\xe2\x80\x9d, oh, you mean the category 5 hurricane you completely disregarded? Yah, it\xe2\x80\x99s getting pretty bad. I liked this guy better unconscious.  To be fair, he\xe2\x80\x99s probably in a bit of shock, as evidenced by him not realizing his leg was snapped in two. He really needs to get a splint on that.  Oh no, Haley\xe2\x80\x99s phone received a message, now she has to go get it so she can text her friend back. I\xe2\x80\x99m about to deduct her score to 6/10 here. Going for your phone is just too much risk for too little gain. Who are you going to call? Beth? Her inability to rescue you should be obvious. The police or animal control? Good luck with that, I'm sure they\xe2\x80\x99ll want to risk their lives fishing alligators out of your basement during a hurricane in this fictional world where gators are this cunning, aggressive, and deadly. Hell, in this fictional world, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why anyone would ever live in Florida. It\xe2\x80\x99d be like living in Jurassic Park with the power out. Nope, I think I can deal with a few cold winter months instead.  Look, I'd get it if your uncle was Jocko Willink, who would swim through the hurricane's flood waters to get to you, choking out any gators that got in his way with his biceps. Actually, he\xe2\x80\x99d probably answer the phone and just say good. Dad went missing in a category 5 hurricane?  Found him unconscious and bleeding out from an alligator attack?  Got attacked by more alligators and now you\xe2\x80\x99re both trapped in a flooding crawl space.  They have the opportunity to reevaluate why you made such horrible decisions. We all know they won\xe2\x80\x99t though. Time for galaxy brain move. They could just break through the wood floor above them. It\xe2\x80\x99s so obvious and simple, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve thought that even Dave and Haley could figure this out, but they never do. With them being trapped in a crawl space being so central to the plot, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you choose a house that had a concrete slab over the basement so it\xe2\x80\x99s actually realistic. From this shot it just looks like some old wooden planks held in by rusty nails. They could probably lay on their backs and kick them loose. Well, Haley could. Dave could probably kick some boards loose with one leg though. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even need to kick them loose, later on in the movie we see Dave crawl a few feet from their safe space to grab his tool belt and shovel. They should easily be able to pry and push the boards above them loose and escape. Dave is a home contractor for fucks sake, how was this option never tried this entire movie. Yep, Haley decides that securing her Iphone is the best method for getting out of here. Could she at least go around her dad instead of crawling over his shattered leg. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like Dave at all, but he\xe2\x80\x99s your dad and there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to risk kneeing his fractured tibia. Her dad tells her to go around to the left, because he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s safer. You literally just became conscious. You have no idea where the alligator is or what has happened since you got bitten. What would possibly make you think that that is a safer route? If anything, taking the longer, more convoluted maze route is far more dangerous than a straight shot to the phone where you can quickly backtrack back past the pipes if necessary. After giving her shitty directions, Professor Dave then starts doling out some unfounded alligator facts to Haley. Thanks, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think i\xe2\x80\x99m going to be taking advice from the dude who put himself in a precarious position and got bitten. I\xe2\x80\x99d bet my life his gator-facts are bullshit too.  He first tells her that alligators can\xe2\x80\x99t hear out of the water. Patently false. Then he says that they can see in the dark well. That\xe2\x80\x99s actually true, they do have great night vision, but still, it's pretty common sense. His last piece of advice is that alligators aren\xe2\x80\x99t as fast out of the water. This is technically true, they are faster in the water. But when you\xe2\x80\x99re forced to crawl barefeet in the mud, they are definitely way faster than you. Telling Haley this is horribly misleading and just gives her extremely dangerous levels of confidence.  I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised Dave lived long enough to have kids.
