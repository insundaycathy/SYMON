If your friend wanted you to join them to explore the gates of hell underneath the catacombs, what would you do? In this How to Beat video, we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow the characters, see if we can make better decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat the hell caves in, As Above So Below. If you think you have a better way, let me know in the comments! If you like these how to beat videos, consider subscribing. Before we ridicule the characters for being morons for the next 20 minutes, I want to say thank you to everyone for being a part of this channel. I love talking about this stuff, and it\xe2\x80\x99s cool to see that so many other people do too. So yah, thank you! Alright, let\xe2\x80\x99s get to it. We start out following a wannabe Lara Croft who trespasses into an Iranian cave in search of historical treasures. Apparently these treasures are worth dying for, because the Iranian military is just about to demolish the cave she\xe2\x80\x99s going into. The timing works out though, because in mere seconds, she finds the lost satanic statue that her dad was looking for his whole life. She\xe2\x80\x99s forced to retreat when the demolition countdown draws down. In her escape she runs into a random dude hanging from the ceiling. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty creepy. Before she can process what the fuck is going on, the cave starts exploding. Scarlett makes it out of the cave just in time, narrowly avoiding being buried alive. Thanks for telling me that now. And if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, why are you putting on open tours to what is essentially a map for finding the stone? How do you even know that everyone who chased Flamel\xe2\x80\x99s stone died. Have you already shown this map to lots of other people, which led them to their deaths, if so, why are you putting on open tours to it? Then again, if everyone looking for it is as reckless as Scarlett, i\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it\xe2\x80\x99s a mystery why everyone\xe2\x80\x99s ending up dead. We cut over to a much more cheery Scarlett, being interviewed at an archaeological dig site in Paris. I guess seeing the apparition of a dead guy hanging from the cave ceiling where she found a mysterious satanic statue was something she didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel the need to reflect on at all. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna fast-forward through a lot of Nicolas Cage National Treasure stuff here, but basically Scarlett is still hunting for the philosopher's stone, which is a mythical substance that was said to turn base metal into gold and grant humans immortality. From all the raging clues they have, they deduce where the stone might be. Naturally, it\xe2\x80\x99s in a pretty inconvenient location. They\xe2\x80\x99d just need to go down into the catacombs, hop over the off-limits barriers, crawl through some bone-filled corridor, slip past the gates of hell without anyone noticing, and carefully snatch the stone while tossing a bag of sand in its place. Personally, if I was looking for the immortality stone, which our previous tour guide said is a death sentence, then I started seeing apparitions of dead people, and the next step in the journey was to enter the gates of hell, I think I'd take a knee, grab an eclair and visit the Eiffel Tower instead. But Scarlett\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be phased by this, I mean earlier she jumped into a cave that was about to be demolished in minutes. Scarlett and Benji, her cameraman do some recon by joining a tour of the catacombs. A stranger that\xe2\x80\x99s kickin it in the catacombs overhears Scarlett, and tells her about a group that can help them into the off-limits area. Sounds legit. The tour guide distracts them by urging them to stay with the group, and when they look back, the guy had Jason Bourned out of there. In the time before they looked back he definitely could have left through that right corridor, but he\xe2\x80\x99d have to be really quick and sneaky, which is odd because he was originally just chilling with his Etch-A-Sketch. Even if I wanted to continue to find the stone, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I'd want to take the advice of some sneaky strange dude in the catacombs. That sounds like a good way to get Taken, and Benji doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have the very particular set of skills needed in that situation. Bringing in outside help and leading an official expedition to find and excavate the philosopher\xe2\x80\x99s stone from deep inside the catacombs is unlikely to be approved, so going in secretly is their only real option. They hit up the club to find Papillon so he can help them enter the off-limits area. What the fuck is up with that chick. There must be some good shit at the party. Okay, she's obviously infatuated with us, but why. No random girl at a club is going to check you out like that unless you\xe2\x80\x99re Magic Mike. It\xe2\x80\x99s probably a good idea to keep an eye on your drink so you don\xe2\x80\x99t wake up in a bathtub with a kidney missing. Lara croft finds her new tour guide to lead them into the gates of hell, oh wait, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention that part to Papillon, oh well. Only George, Benji, and Scarlett know that they are headed towards the mythological gates of hell, but Scarlett is the only one that has actually seen a ghost on her quest to find the stone. Nobody but Scarlett has any reason to believe that there might be terrible things awaiting them, and she might just think her mind played tricks on her. Considering the stone and treasures would be a huge discovery, and there\xe2\x80\x99s not really a strong reason to believe they will actually enter hell, calling the hunt off is not reasonable. It is dangerous though. While they prepare to enter the catacombs, Benji asks one of Papi\xe2\x80\x99s team members a quick last minute question. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad safety is coming first. This stone has never been found, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone else is hot on Scarlett\xe2\x80\x99s trail. I think they can afford a few days to mull over the plan. I\xe2\x80\x99m no Les Stroud, but I am known for my pro Wiki-how survivor tips. Seriously though, this knowledge is 100% relevant to the crew's survival as you\xe2\x80\x99ll see later. The Paris catacombs is a nearly 200 mile long maze of pitch black tunnels that are easy to get lost in. In 2017, two teenagers got lost, and it took a whole Fire Brigade and cataphile operation to rescue them 3 days later. Cataphiles are people that frequently explore the off-limits areas. Not to mention the area the teens got lost in was considered to be a very \xe2\x80\x9ctouristy\xe2\x80\x9d beginners area of the off-limits zone by the cataphiles. I know they expect to only be down there for a few hours, but with what they are doing, they could easily end up down there for multiple days if something goes wrong. Here\xe2\x80\x99s what I would bring: Basic stuff like a First-Aid kit, and extra food and water. Waterproof headlamps with spares and extra batteries. Miners lamps for backup light and a heat source. A helmet is pretty much a no brainer. Thermal blankets because at 55 degrees down there, it\xe2\x80\x98s cold enough to give you hypothermia if exposed for over a day or two. Wetsuits and goggles, waterproof boots, and waterproof bags to hold their gear and spare dry clothes because they might have to go through tunnels that are flooded with freezing water. Freezing water pulls heat from your body 25 times faster than air, so if you don\xe2\x80\x99t stay dry you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at hypothermia in hours instead of days. Abrasion resistant caving oversuits for crawling around. Since they will probably need to go up or down shafts, bringing multiple ropes with harnesses and gloves, as well as other proper cave rappelling gear including ascenders, descenders, and rope protectors. The ropes need to be placed in waterproof bags, because a wet rope can be 40-70% weaker, and is much more likely to be sliced through by a jagged edge. Line markers to know your way back, but also for rescue teams since you\xe2\x80\x99re going into an area that\xe2\x80\x99s designed to not be found. Other good precautions to take would include making sure everyone in the search group is aware of all the dangers and conditions. You can\xe2\x80\x99t have phobias of confined spaces, rats, or cobwebby bones, because you can\xe2\x80\x99t exactly leave whenever you start feeling sick. I know they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to be secretive, but telling a trusted friend beforehand, that you are going into the catacombs via this entrance and taking this route, as well as when you expect to be back, is always a good idea. There\xe2\x80\x99s honestly so much more to cover. The bigger point though, is that after a couple hours of reading about cave exploration, I realized I don\xe2\x80\x99t know jack shit about cave exploration. Maybe I should back off until I get the proper gear, training, and guide instead of grabbing some rope off the wall boondock saints style and jumping into an uncharted cave half-cocked. You\xe2\x80\x99re also far from justice. An important rule that Cataphiles state, is to never trust anyone else unless you really know them well because you are basically at their mercy. Obviously Scarlett is breaking this rule by finding a guide in a nightclub. Scarlett\xe2\x80\x99s crew decides to ignore most of what I mentioned and hastily enter the catacombs with a bunch of strangers. George obviously hasn\xe2\x80\x99t learned anything from his time in a Turkish prison, which he was thrown into because of Scarlett's shenanigans, and Benji is naive enough to ignore George\xe2\x80\x99s warnings about how dangerous she is. Things quickly go south once they reach the secret catacomb entrance. Yah, the police wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that. It\xe2\x80\x99s illegal, but generally speaking it's a slap on the wrist and a 60 euro fine. Getting into a brawl with a cop and throwing smoke bombs at them probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t wise, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be unlikely to help you if you need to be rescued later. I\xe2\x80\x99d take the fine and come back later. All in all, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great way to start their expedition, panicked and stressed. What was that precaution about not entering caves with people that are afraid of them? I know they were forced to enter the catacombs, but generally you\xe2\x80\x99d want to find a close exit to let this guy out first so he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t become a danger to others. Something tells me they are going to force this guy to come with them into the uncharted cave network instead. Graffiti is one way to mark your way back I guess.. But yah basically they don\xe2\x80\x99t use any line markers like we talked about. Notice how they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the proper shoes or clothing setup, considering they knew they were going to be wading through freezing cold water at the start of their trip. Yep. Oh shit it\xe2\x80\x99s that creepy chick from the party. She is a freak. And this is where the gloves and caving oversuit would be helpful. They really are not prepared at all for things they knew they\xe2\x80\x99d run into. What the fuck did you think you were going to be doing when exploring the off limits areas of the catacombs. Again, nobody in this group is on the same page here. And here we encounter the classic shortcut mistake. Scarlett wants to save a few hours off the trip by taking an unknown route. Where do I remember this from, oh yah, The Ritual. That didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out well for them. I\xe2\x80\x99m with the tour guide. A map doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you shit, and we know nothing about this tunnel. Urban legends and evil mythology aside, if the guide's friend, La Taupe, knew these tunnels like the back of his hand and never returned from that tunnel, at the very least it\xe2\x80\x99s just plain dangerous. Luckily, they follow Papi\xe2\x80\x99s lead. Of course they brought a dude into the catacombs that is scared of bones, rats, and confined spaces. Good job team. I like how George\xe2\x80\x99s brother died in a fucking cave and he isn\xe2\x80\x99t as panicky as Benji. To be fair, the satanic cult chanting in the background is unnerving. Benji just nearly avoids becoming a permanent resident of the catacombs when the tunnel collapses behind him. The train really goes off the rails when they end up at a dead end, which was impossible according to Papi, as he knows this area well. Since Benji caused the tunnel to collapse, the only way out now is the same evil tunnel they avoided earlier. Maybe Papi just got turned around somehow, but continuing deeper into the collapsing off-limits area when you are already cut-off from your exit route probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t the smartest move. I\xe2\x80\x99d call off the hunt right here. Since we would\xe2\x80\x99ve told a friend where we were going, and used line markers, we\xe2\x80\x99d be here for half a day at most before getting rescued. You can come back later once the tunnel is cleared. Scarlett decides to boldly forge on through the evil tunnel, and immediately things get weird. They see Papi\xe2\x80\x99s tag on the wall, but he swears he never entered this place. He seems to be genuinely freaked out and not fucking with us, but then again, can we really trust the tour guide we met at a nightclub? Okay.. how about fuck no. Now I\xe2\x80\x99d definitely go back and chill at the collapsed tunnel and wait for help. Since our protagonists didn\xe2\x80\x99t let anyone know or use line markers, their only option is to push forward as it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely anyone will find them for days. The weirdness continues when they find an old piano. George says that it's the same type of piano he had when he was a kid, except the A4 key was dead. I feel like I should break out the banana split analogy from the Polaroid video I did. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what we are up to, maybe the 3 scoops of get the fuck out ice cream? What do you guys think? Scarlett has the bright idea to keep moving forward despite all this creepy stuff happening. She runs off further into the tunnel by herself. She really wanted to know who was calling. George was right, this chick is nuts. They chase after her and catch up once she finds the ringing phone. Papi\xe2\x80\x99s tag showing up in unexplored tunnels, weird. The piano, highly coincidental and very spooky. A phone ringing without any electricity, this is the first truly impossible thing they\xe2\x80\x99ve encountered. Scarlett answers the phone. I was expecting Samara to give her 7 days, but I'm pretty sure the guy on the other line is thinking more like today instead. The impossibility continues as the man knows it\xe2\x80\x99s Scarlett on the phone. And I'd be back to the collapsed tunnel, line markers or not. Clearly the gates of hell wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just an urban legend. I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to cover a bunch of other warning signs they blow past real quickly as there are literally too many. There\xe2\x80\x99s probably 3 banana splits worth of warnings before people start dying. All the previously mentioned stuff, plus: Finding a pissed off creepy La Taupe that teleports. The ceiling cracked with loose stones falling on the ground. La Taupe eerily saying the only way out of the catacombs is to go further down. Having to rappel down a well without proper gear or training. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t wearing gloves, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have proper descenders with auto-stop mechanisms, they are rappelling multiple people down the well simultaneously. God damn Benji is a liability. Descenders would have prevented Benji from an uncontrolled fall, gloves would\xe2\x80\x99ve prevented his hands from serious abrasions, and going one at a time would\xe2\x80\x99ve prevented George from receiving Benji\xe2\x80\x99s Diving Hurricanrana. (wrestling scene) Everyone randomly going deaf. A demonic earthquake. A ghost child. Egyptian padlocks that kill you Indian Jones style. Great so there are ancient booby traps too. They correctly solve the riddle, which unlocks the Egyption padlock, revealing a secret passageway. Why the fuck are ancient civilizations so cryptic with these riddles, \xe2\x80\x9cThe winged vulture is the bright light in the seventh hour of the moonlight's gaze upon a virgin goat\xe2\x80\x9d. My security phrases are more like, what\xe2\x80\x99s your dog\xe2\x80\x99s name? Old dead guy in a tomb whose body hasn't rotted for some mysterious reason. Having to cave dive in uncharted underwater catacomb tunnels with no gear. Random treasures next to lit fires. Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s 12 right there, I think by now you\xe2\x80\x99d have ample evidence to suggest backing the fuck out of the evil tunnel, and just waiting for someone to hopefully rescue you. You should be able to survive for long enough by drinking tunnel water and eating Benji. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry guys, you should have known I'd bring up cannibalism. They find the philosopher's stone, but it too is booby trapped. And the ceiling collapses when Papi\xe2\x80\x99s crew tries to jack the treasure. How has nobody been killed yet, it\xe2\x80\x99s honestly a miracle. This kind of shit is why you\xe2\x80\x99d want to be wearing a helmet, any of those falling stones easily could have killed them. Their luck has to be running out here. Suoxie\xe2\x80\x99s arm gets smashed, but Scarlett applies some stone dust which magically heals it. Unfortunately, La Taupe was cut off from the group. They don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt a rescue for fear of risking further collapse. I feel sorry for La Taupe, that\xe2\x80\x99s the second time he was left behind by Papi. Scarlett solves the most important riddle of the movie. Which reveals another secret passageway below them. They toss the rope down the shaft and make their descent. The rope grinding on the edge of the rock is not good. They need to use a rope protector to reduce friction between the rope and the jagged edge so the rope doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get sheared in half leaving them stranded. Nothing has deterred the group thus far, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not like they have any other option at this point. It\xe2\x80\x99s like Churchill said, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going through hell, keep going. Except I think he was speaking metaphorically, while they are literally going into hell. I think Churchill would have advised them to not enter literal hell since they have a choice. Dude, Benji bitched about rats, but when Scarlett mentions walking through the gates of hell, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t voice any concern. There\xe2\x80\x99s no backing out now, as the entrance was sealed behind them. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying that same stupid phrase this whole expedition, and each time things got markedly worse. They find La Taupe, only this time he wasn't as forgiving as the first time Papi left him. Scarlett tries shaving some stone dust onto Souxie\xe2\x80\x99s caved in face, which surprisingly didn't work. More red flags pop up like a random noose and a baby crying. It was a baby crying, are you expecting a response to your question. Not only that, but you\xe2\x80\x99re in hell and it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a demonic apparition. Come on. Benji forgot his auto-stop descender again, and when the cult chick jumpscares him, he falls to his death. This guy really sucks at rappelling. Sigh. George's see\xe2\x80\x99s his deceased brother underwater and flips out trying to save him, but his ghost disappears. Hell puts on a little reunion for Papi and his friend who he presumably killed in some accident. Papi isn\xe2\x80\x99t as lucky as George, and while screaming it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t his fault, he gets pulled into the burning car before it vanishes in thin air. I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure he died because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t take extreme ownership of the accident. Okay, I seriously think Scarlett watched way too many motivational videos with Rocky Balboa. They \xe2\x80\x98keep moving forward\xe2\x80\x99 because that\xe2\x80\x99s been working so well for them, and they run into the fucking grim reaper. That's what you get for shining a flashlight in his face while he's trying to sleep. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard enough to catch some z\xe2\x80\x99s with the wall people moaning and whining. Zed\xe2\x80\x99s doing a great job of keeping the main protagonists centered in frame. Excellent camerawork. George gets his neck ripped open by the wall people, and Scarlett tries to use the immortality stone again, to no avail. For all the hype around this stone, it actually kind of sucks. George mutters something about vitriol, rectifying, hidden stones, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know but Scarlett bolts off, leaving Zed holding a dirty shirt against Georges open neck wound. She jukes one cave demon, brutally stiff-arms another, bare-handedly ascends the rope Benji fell from, traverses the pit of blood filled with creepy crawlers, slips past her own undead corpse hanging from the ceiling, and returns the ruby to its rightful place. This is like Hell\xe2\x80\x99s version of Ninja Warrior. The whole, As Above, So Below epiphany hits her. The devil just needed a hug to stop the violence, and the only thing she has to fear is fear itself. She returns to the hangman, which was actually her dad. She hugs him and makes amends, which resolves her inner conflict, ending the nightmare. Scarlett does some Trinity shit to bring back George. Where the stone failed, love prevailed. So deep. I was thinking go back to back, but sure, your mystical intuition seems to finally be paying off, so lets do it. Well the catacombs do interconnect with the subway system in some areas, just kidding they survive it. They open a manhole cover and Scarlett pops out and gets run over by a truck. Joking again but seriously she exited feet first without checking if a car was coming, it easily could have happened. I\xe2\x80\x99m honestly shocked that zed didn\xe2\x80\x99t die, but like so many people mentioned in the comments of my previous videos, he was holding the main camera. The movie ends with Zed, George, and Scarlett all severely crippled with PTSD and survivors guilt for the rest of their lives, but having learned a moral lesson about rectifying your sins. Let\xe2\x80\x99s recap whose lives we could\xe2\x80\x99ve saved, and whose death was inevitable. With the proper gear and training I think that everyone could have survived. The most important thing they easily could\xe2\x80\x99ve done is to use line markers and let a trusted person know where they were going and when they should be back. These single-handedly would\xe2\x80\x99ve enabled them to chill at the collapsed tunnel and wait for help. From the moment the tunnel collapsed behind Benji, all the way up to them passing through the gates of hell with La Taupe fuck-starting Souxie\xe2\x80\x99s head, they were given every warning and every chance to backout and wait for help. It became so obvious that they were going to get themselves killed that it almost seemed miraculous nobody had died up until that point. So Scarlett, George, Benji, Papi, Souxie, and Zed would all survive. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the hell was wrong with La Taupe, but i\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure he was already dead. Overall, I\xe2\x80\x99d say this situation was pretty beatable. Thanks for watching, and remember, don\xe2\x80\x99t follow your Lara Croft, Indiana Jones wannabe friends into the gates of hell .
