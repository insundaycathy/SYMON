\xef\xbb\xbfIf you got stuck in a remote Alaskan village that hungry vampire\xe2\x80\x99s descended upon, what would you do? In this How to Beat video, we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow Barrow\xe2\x80\x99s townsfolk, see if we can make better decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat the Bloodthirsty Vampires in, 30 Days of Night. If you think you have a better way, let me know in the comments! If you like these how to beat videos, consider liking and subscribing.  We start out getting a little backstory on a town full of innocent people who\xe2\x80\x99re about to be massacred. It\xe2\x80\x99s a real town called Barrow, Alaska with about 4000 residents. They go on to say it\xe2\x80\x99s the Northernmost town in Alaska surrounded by 80 miles of roadless wilderness, and that for 30 days of their winter season, it\xe2\x80\x99s completely cut off from the rest of the world.  Since it\xe2\x80\x99s a real town, I think we can dig up some more background on it that might be helpful.  The movie is correct about it being the Northernmost town, as well as having 80 miles of roadless snowy tundra between it and the next closest town, but their point about the town being completely cut off for 30 days of the polar night is incorrect.  Because the town is isolated by roadless tundra and resupply by truck is treacherous, the only real way the town gets food and supplies is by plane. Every ounce of food is flown in, which is why flights to Barrow are completed using planes that are half passenger seats and half cargo space. Multiple flights come in and out of Wiley Post-Will Rogers Memorial Airport on a daily basis, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t stop because it\xe2\x80\x99s dark outside.  Boats do supply the town as well, but only in the summer when the ice surrounding the coast is broken and melted enough. It is possible for trucks to make the drive to neighboring towns in the winter polar nights when the tundra is frozen solid. It\xe2\x80\x99s risky, but if there was an emergency and a bad storm grounded all aircraft or all the pilots were murdered, you could make it out of town to get help. This is good news for our protagonists, because they aren\xe2\x80\x99t as cut off from the world as they think.  It\xe2\x80\x99s not all good news though, the polar night is not 30 days long as the movie suggests, it\xe2\x80\x99s actually over 60 days long. The vampires have twice the time for their feeding frenzy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the vampires will need this much time though, if they do things right, they likely could suck out everyone's blood in less than a week. I might play both sides on this one because the vampires undoubtedly are going to do dumb shit.  A mysterious ship arrives at the coast, probably around the Elson Lagoon area which would be remote enough that nobody would see the ship. They likely chose this area because if the ship was seen, people would be suspicious of it. Like we talked about, normal ships need to wait until a narrow window of time in the summer when the ice is melted enough for the ship to get close enough to drop supplies off.  The next morning Josh Hartnett and Crixus find a bunch of satellite phones torched in the snow. For all they know, it could just be thieves, vandals, or pranksters.  With some of the townsfolk on the fictional last flight out before the fictional 30 day polar night, the strange happenings in the small town continue. Someone is shanking all the sled dogs. I get the vampire\xe2\x80\x99s strategy of eliminating any transportation or communication out of the town, but killing sled dogs? Is that really important at this stage? What dumb son of a bitch would try to escape a vampire attack on a dog sled with a bunch of howling Alaskan Malamutes pulling some dude at a breakneck speed of 5 miles per hour.  The vampire\xe2\x80\x99s next objectives are to have the human destroy the town\xe2\x80\x99s helicopter and cell tower right before the polar night begins. I gotta commend the vampire\xe2\x80\x99s here, destroying most of the satellite phones first before destroying the cell tower was key. If they had destroyed the cell tower first, obtaining and destroying the satellite phones would have been much more difficult since it\xe2\x80\x99s the only remaining means of communication and people will hold onto them tightly. The sat phones being destroyed wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t raise any immediate red flags, and then all you\xe2\x80\x99d need to do to cut the town\xe2\x80\x99s comms is take out the single cell tower.  Shortly after losing comms with the outside world, the town will send people out to get help via plane or helicopter, so disabling these aircraft quickly is important. Once that option is off the table, the townsfolk will resort to sending some truck drivers to nearby towns to get help. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the vampires would need to worry about a mass exodus 2 fast 2 furious style because it\xe2\x80\x99s risky and there\xe2\x80\x99s no need if you only need a few drivers to make the trip. While it\xe2\x80\x99s a roadless tundra, i\xe2\x80\x99m sure there are established routes in and out of town. All you\xe2\x80\x99d need to do is have some vampires guard these routes and kill any escapees.  The next problem is the daily resupply flights. This is a tough one. If you destroy the landing planes, the airlines will be alerted immediately. It might take a few days of no contact and planes being destroyed for the National Guard to be called in, but a few hundred soldiers with Blackhawks showing up will definitely ruin the vampire party.  Damaging the runway could be a way to get the town to suspend flights for a while, but when the town survives on that runway, it\xe2\x80\x99ll get fixed quickly. As a vampire attacking this town, I\xe2\x80\x99d say realistically the feast can only last maybe a week max before your welcome is overstayed. But this is a fictional world where no flights come and go for a month, so let\xe2\x80\x99s continue with that premise.  The remaining problem is world awareness of your vampirical existence. As a vampire, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want the world to know about your existence because 4chan will find you and the military will kill you. This is a difficult task because every person you bite or slash gets infected with the vampire virus, which spreads evidence of your existence.  Leaving bodies in the open where the sunlight will vaporize them after the polar night ends won\xe2\x80\x99t work, because you need to be out of town within a week, and the polar night lasts a couple months. I think that if you cut off comms and transportation like they did, destroy any planes that land, kill everyone as fast as you can, then on the last day of the week, burn the village down which will destroy any evidence as well as flush out the remaining victims who you can kill and toss into the fire, you should be good.  People are going to be suspicious as to what caused everyone to die and the town to burn down, but nobody will suspect it was a vampire pack.  Their current plan is a bit over the top and risky. They could just visit the coastal towns and abduct a few people from each town per year. Then harvest their blood on their ship for the rest of the year before killing them and abducting a few more the next year. It\xe2\x80\x99s not crazy that few people might go missing from each town once out of the year due to wolves or polar bear attacks. This is just a much more long term sustainable strategy, and sustainable living is really what we\xe2\x80\x99re after right, not some one time gluttonous feast that destroys the town causing you to be deprived for decades.  Back to the movie. So the vampire human shanked some dogs, and Stella's trying to make the fictional last flight out before no more flights for 30 days.  How the hell does that even happen. You're on a lunar landscape with open sightlines. Well, Stella\xe2\x80\x99s not getting to the airport in time. Eben sends Billy to go pick Stella up while he chats with the owners of the murdered dogs. Maybe this dude just pissed someone off.  Back at the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office, reports are coming in about a vandal at the Utilidor. That\xe2\x80\x99s not good. Utilidors typically carry lines for electricity, steam, water supply, sewage, communications, and other important stuff. This is a small town with low crime and most people know each other. These events all happening on the same day is strange. It\xe2\x80\x99s likely it\xe2\x80\x99s one pissed off person. It might be wise to contact neighboring towns to let them know that you are having issues with people attempting to destroy essential systems, and that you may need assistance if communications go down. With all that\xe2\x80\x99s happening, and with no aircraft at the airport, I'd be worried about someone vandalizing the cell tower and gas stations.  Stella missed the last flight out for the month. I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing they are anticipating a storm arriving that would ground the planes, because otherwise flights should still be arriving.  Down at the Utilidor, one of the men mentions that his helicopter was scrapped and the parts tossed into the muffin monster. God those things are terrifying. All it takes is one simple mistake, like a loose shoelace you trip on, and all your memories, hopes, dreams, your love for your family, your connection to your community, all gets instantly grinded up into a red pulpy soup which\xe2\x80\x99s flushed down the sewage pipes. I think by now it\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable for Eben to realize that someone is purposefully removing any communication or transportation out of town. I\xe2\x80\x99d be trying to contact all the other vital utility managers to take precautions, and radioing nearby towns and the national guard that they may be in trouble if the vandals destroy the cell tower too because they won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to call for help. Not that it will matter. Oh come on, who would actually go outside after hearing that noise. If you go to check some weird occurrence out, you better have a plan for how to deal with it if your worst case scenario comes true.  I mean yah, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know there are vampires outside, but there are still polar bears and wolves that kill humans from time to time. It\xe2\x80\x99s just not wise to go wandering out into the snowy abyss by yourself with no weapons when you heard some animalistic shrieking outside. Seriously, what the hell is this guy going to do if a polar bear or pack of wolves show up. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to get mauled, drug off into the snowdrift, and turned into wolf shit.  Pretty much just like that, except he\xe2\x80\x99s getting turned into vampire shit. That said, it never really mattered what this dude did anyways. The first person to realize there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem is usually in trouble, especially if that problem is a pack of blood sucking vampires.  I know I don\xe2\x80\x99t have much room to talk, but c\xe2\x80\x99mon, the apocalypse hasn't even started yet bro. Pump the breaks a bit. And you\xe2\x80\x99re not even a vampire, just a wannabe who\xe2\x80\x99s likely being played for a fool and who will definitely get sick from eating raw meat.  Eben finds the new guy in town causing trouble, a likely suspect for all the shenanigans going on. A tussle ensues, which is promptly ended by Stella putting a gun to the man\xe2\x80\x99s head.  Thanks and all, but Stella, you do realize that the gun is pointed at my head too, and if you pull that trigger the bullet will go through his head and into mine. Maybe come around to the side so i\xe2\x80\x99m not in the line of fire.  I'd take that seriously. This dude was likely the one cutting off the town's transportation and communication. The good news is this dipshit can\xe2\x80\x99t keep his mouth shut, so Josh needs to interrogate him to figure out his motives and what\xe2\x80\x99s going on. Best case this guy is just a loon, but what\xe2\x80\x99s the worst case? Damn, these vampires are freaky fast. That kind of speed and strength is nearly impossible to counter without firearms and expert marksmanship. Hand to hand combat is pretty much a death sentence.  So far nobody in town has been able to identify the problem and sound the alarms because the Vampire\xe2\x80\x99s have been doing a good job of stealthily knocking off isolated people.  Eben interrogates the man, asking how he got into town, because clearly he's not from here. Is that really an important question to ask right now? I think figuring out his motive and if he has friends is more important. The interrogation is interrupted when the phone lines and internet go down. Either that\xe2\x80\x99s pure coincidence, or this guy has friends with ill intentions too. Eben should be considering the latter.  Time to lock and load. Whoever these people are, whatever they are up to, they slaughtered someone\xe2\x80\x99s dogs, so at minimum they are armed and dangerous. And with no rescue efforts available and limited resources, you should stock up, find shelter and weapons, and watch your back. No help will arrive if something bad happens or a dipshit runs into you with a backhoe.  Come on Eben, there is no way you should be as nonchalant about this as you are, what happened to having a healthy level of paranoia. Eben decides to check out the cell tower situation by himself. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, where is deputy Crixus again? I also find it odd that the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have it\xe2\x80\x99s own satellite phone they could use. Hmm. Maybe the wind blew the tower down... or the polar bear's situation is getting out of hand.  They are not fucking around anymore. Everything before this was the covert setup phase. This is a declaration of war. Get back and tell everyone to get out their guns and shelter in place because people are now being murdered with their corpses put on public display.  Then, get your deputy and load up yourself and start trying to hunt down whoever is doing this. Yes! I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought about this as a solution in some movies like the blob, because it\xe2\x80\x99s just such a good way to raise awareness quickly, but I always thought you\xe2\x80\x99d seem crazy and nobody would listen. I think the idea is always good, but people screw the execution up by sounding crazy. You have to dial it back, so for example, even if you know it\xe2\x80\x99s vampires, you just say it\xe2\x80\x99s serial killers or something.  Josh\xe2\x80\x99s execution is solid, and considering he\xe2\x80\x99s the Sheriff and all the power and phone lines are out, his words are gonna carry weight. His plan he\xe2\x80\x99s disseminating is that whoever has a backup generator should head home, and everyone else should go to the diner which has a backup generator itself. Again, based on what they know at this point, that\xe2\x80\x99s about the best plan you could offer. Too bad it\xe2\x80\x99s also woefully insufficient.  With how lightning fast and strong the vamps are, you don\xe2\x80\x99t stand a chance unless they are way out in the open or funneled into a chokepoint. These vampires can dive through windows and smash through wood with ease. Racking a shotty and backing up to a concrete or brick wall is most people\xe2\x80\x99s best bet, but most of these little piggies only have their stick houses to hide in.  Ebens dumbass brother falls for the oldest prisoner trick in the book, which is to emotionally trigger someone so they get close enough to grab. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing Eben was on his way back to save the day, because Stella just stood around useless while Jake was getting choked out. Eben and Stella decide to ride out and look for the murderers, because deputy Billy is on vacation apparently.  Stella was hauling ass when that dude jumped on, I know the Vampires are fast, but that is insane. The fact that the dude caught up to them, shrieked, and was out there in the snow drift and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t frozen to death in the negative 20 degree temps means some spooky shit is going on.  Back at the town, it doesn't look like the shelter in place order helped much.  I think it\xe2\x80\x99s underestimated how fast apocalypses happen. You could have the best doomsday prepper setup, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re at taco bell when shit goes down, you aren\xe2\x80\x99t making it. You\xe2\x80\x99d be lucky to get half a Nacho Cheese Dorito Loco taco down your gullet before a vamp breaks your car window and sinks their teeth into your neck. Saying that just made me hungry. Back in the day when I would play video games until 3am, I'd naturally get really hungry and go to Mcdonalds to get a 20 pack of nuggets and orange hi-c. But you know what, I never let my guard down. Seatbelt on, car gear in reverse with my foot on the break, windows up, parked in an area where you have open sightlines, 1 nugget 1 look procedure. My point is that you gotta anticipate the worst case situation no matter what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing, and develop mental models and procedures for handling those situations. I really hope I'm not the only one who from time to time thinks, what if all of the sudden I heard a scream outside my home, looked outside, and zombies were ripping someone apart. What would I do right in that moment?  I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to wonder if something really awful happened to me in my childhood that I'm currently repressing. Probably best not to look into it, back to the movie.  Stella and Eben get back from their field trip. There's blood everywhere and Jake and Helen are both gone. Judging by Helen\xe2\x80\x99s screams on the radio earlier, she\xe2\x80\x99s already vamp food.  Jake must have ran for it while Helen, being a slower old lady, got slaughtered. I see he took my advice from the end of my last video. That leads me to my next semi-pro tip, always be faster than at least 1 person around you. If you are the slowest person in the room, figure out a way to sabotage someone else who\xe2\x80\x99s faster to buy you time. Don\xe2\x80\x99t hate the player, hate the game.  The jail bro is now complaining that the vamp god didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn him into a vampire too, so he wants Eben to finish him off. Eben decides not to, seemingly for moral reasons, but i\xe2\x80\x99d like to add that it would be a terrible decision also because a desk pop is going to attract unwanted attention from whoever, whatever is doing the killing. The people that went to the diner are all freaking out, it seems like they know there are murderers outside. What I don\xe2\x80\x99t get is if you realize that the power is out with multiple attackers outside killing people, why are you making so much noise, why do you still have the lights on and why are you all sitting around casually with some morons sitting with their backs to the windows. You might as well hang up a Krispy Kreme hot light and get on your knees. The funny part is that the people at the diner are the smart ones. Everyone else apparently decided the best course of action is to run outside like chickens who can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to get their heads cut off.  Everyone at the diner is lucky Eben shows up and shuts the lights off before the vampires notice the one building in the middle of town that\xe2\x80\x99s glowing with lights when the power is out in every other house. He also locks the doors, which might seem futile, but it\xe2\x80\x99s actually a good call because the vampires would have to break in which would give you slightly more time to react than if they were able to sneak in. Eben proposes his plan to load up a truck with bear traps and flares to distract the vamps while everyone else runs for a nearby house that has an attic which is only accessible by a hidden pulldown ladder.  Honestly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad strategy to create a diversion, like lighting a house's curtains on fire, while you sneak off to your truck a block away. The vamps are fast, but by the time the fire became noticeable and attracted the vamps, you\xe2\x80\x99d have enough of a head start to where they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t catch up to you. If everyone else can hold out and stay hidden in the attic for a couple days, you might be able to make it to the next closest town of Atqasuk, and use their airport and radio to call for help from the National Guard.  Welp, things don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be going according to their plan.  I get that vampires are fast, but stopping an SUV going 35 mph is ridiculous. With that speed and strength a gunshot to the head is definitely your only chance.  Well I guess that works too. I think we can go ahead and wave that citation from earlier.  So they can catch a suv going 30-40 miles per hour, but not josh and stella running on foot, k. The only explanation for this incongruence is that the vampires are hunting them for fun, and they let the humans go for a little chase.  Our band of survivors make it to the hidden attic where they can take a nice slow deep breath and let how fucked they are really sink in. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, where have you been the past 6 hours. Let\xe2\x80\x99s walk down the vampire lore stat sheet that anyone would know. Super fast. Super strong. Voracious appetite for human blood. Shrieky sounds. Sharp teeth. Black eyes. Intelligent. I\xe2\x80\x99d say they check out. At least they acknowledge that vampires exist, that\xe2\x80\x99s better than most movies.  Their plan is to take shifts, ration food, and hold out until the polar night ends.  Based on the movie's fictional 30 days of night, and Alaska Airlines halting flights for a month, this is probably the best strategy unless something changes.  Based on realistic circumstances where the polar night lasts 60 plus days, and Alaska Airlines would continue to make flights to Barrow, the strategy is pretty much the same. The airlines will notice there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem and help will arrive within the week. Unfortunately, there\xe2\x80\x99s no way to signal to the plane that the town is under siege and that landing is a death sentence. The first airline to land will be massacred. Jail bro finally got his ticket to vampire heaven. Why would you even want to join this type of vampires. They are dumb, ugly, and live in a busted as ship docked in some isolated arctic island with no hot vampires or anything to do. If it was the underworld variety, which has sophisticated culture, highly intelligent citizens, superhuman physical abilities, aesthetic physiques, sustainable food sources, incredible architecture and cities, and most importantly, hot vampires, I'd understand his motives, but not these wild animals.  Outside they hear vamps searching nearby homes, which means their current strat isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to work for much longer. Especially with the old man with dementia freaking out every 30 minutes. I hate to say it, but that man is a liability. Even if they can keep him quiet should a vamp enter their home, and even if the attic ladder is hidden, the vampires do have a heightened sense of smell which they could track you down with if they got close enough.  Their new plan is to sneak over to the general store for supplies, then make a second break for the utilidors to hold out there. It\xe2\x80\x99s not too far away, but with vampires potentially anywhere outside it\xe2\x80\x99s extremely risky.  Food will be a problem, but I think they should try to hold out as long as humanly possible before risking going outside, or at least wait for an opportunity. Maybe the vampire\xe2\x80\x99s will get bored, something will provide a good distraction or a whiteout storm will provide them with cover. I would also advise against going to any supermarket or general store. These are prime targets for vampire\xe2\x80\x99s to watch over as survivors start to get hungry and run out of supplies. Raiding other houses is less risky. Their combined body heat in the attic with blankets and coats should keep them warm enough as well.  Going to the utilidor makes sense in some ways because it\xe2\x80\x99s a strong building with choke points you can guard with guns, but that\xe2\x80\x99s only really relevant if they have enough ammo to kill the attacking vamps, which they don\xe2\x80\x99t. They\xe2\x80\x99d have to stop by the police station to get more ammo, which further increases the chances they get caught on top of an already risky plan.  Is there anything else our protagonists can do?  Trying to drive out of town is clearly out of the question, but man, if only we had some sled dogs, right? They could try sneaking into houses they heard the vampires search already because they aren\xe2\x80\x99t likely to search it again, but having your big group which includes a man with dementia traverse open ground just isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth it the risk. The new house might not have super secret hiding spots either.  I think they should stay put in the attic, and to prevent a vampire from sniffing them out, they could try to throw their scent off with household chemicals like ammonia, vinegar, or bleach. This might be their best option. You want to avoid getting into hand to hand combat at all costs, but should you need to, it\xe2\x80\x99s better to be wielding weapons with range. They could break some chairs up and sharpen the legs to use to shank the vampires. The old wooden stake to the heart. You still have almost no chance, but you have a better chance than using your fists.  Guns are the preferred means of vampire disposal, but ammo is sparse, so you want to make sure whoever you\xe2\x80\x99re with who has a gun doesn\xe2\x80\x99t blow their ammo like Russ did in The Crazies.  On the vampire front, they really should maintain a perimeter around the town and start burning the buildings down to flush out any remaining survivors. Manually searching each home is ineffective with only 10-20 vampires in your tribe. You could search a house and then go to the next one, and humans could sneak over to the house you just searched. By burning the houses down you eliminate their hiding places. Day 7.. Wait, 7 days since the polar night started? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this the 1st day of vampire attack. I guess time is hard to judge during the polar night. No, we do not. That\xe2\x80\x99s bait. Eben confirms this suspicion by looking through a peephole in the attic and seeing a vampire on the rooftop behind her lying in wait. Stella, stella, stella, you would have gotten killed right there had it not been for Eben. Even if Eben didn\xe2\x80\x99t spot the vampire, with the lady screaming and how fast the vampire's are, there is no way you could get to her in time. The only reason this lady isn\xe2\x80\x99t dead yet is because the vampire\xe2\x80\x99s are trying to get a 2 for 1. Even if you could rescue her, do you really want a lady in the same attic as you, that thought walking in the middle of the street yelling for help was a good idea?
