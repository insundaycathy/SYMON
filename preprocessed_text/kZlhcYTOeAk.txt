Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here. Before we start, WARNING! Spoilers Ahead! Today, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to recap a 2003 Korean Crime Thriller movie, called Memories of Murder. This movie is loosely based on the true story of South Korea's first confirmed serial murders in 1986, in Hwaseong city. Due to the notoriety of the case, 2 million officers were mobilized. 40,116 individuals were investigated and 21,280 turned into suspects at that time. So, who did the culprit kill? What was the motive behind the killings? Let\xe2\x80\x99s find it out. The movie starts with local detective Park, investigating a crime scene. In the sewer, he finds a woman\xe2\x80\x99s corpse with hands tied behind her back. Nearby, the kids play with the evidence which is the victim\xe2\x80\x99s clothings. The next day, Park starts to interrogate people who have been close to the victim. However, before solving the first murder, he is called to another crime scene where another woman becomes the victim. Her hands are tied behind the back, her underwear cover her face and gag her mouth. He is mad because the forensics team hasn\xe2\x80\x99t arrived and the crime scene has already been destroyed by the villagers who are curious about the incident. While he is at home, his Wife says that there is a mentally handicapped boy named Baek who likes to lurk around women. He also lurked around the last victim before her death. Park immediately goes to the boy\xe2\x80\x99s house to interrogate him. He tries to provoke Baek by talking about his liking towards women. Frustrated by Baek\xe2\x80\x99s denial, Park invites his partner Cho who immediately kicks him down and beats him. In the morning, Seo joins the team to uncover the case. He voluntarily comes down from Seoul to find the culprit. During interrogation, Park and Cho continue to corner Baek for confession by threatening him to bury the boy alive, if he still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to confess. When Park is talking about the victim, Baek suddenly explains how the woman was killed. Even though the team has gotten Baek\xe2\x80\x99s confession, Seo is still unconvinced and continues to study the case\xe2\x80\x99s documents. Having successfully caught the culprit, Park, Cho, and the Chief try to remake the crime scene with the reporters\xe2\x80\x99 coverage, to boost their popularity. However, Seo realizes that Baek\xe2\x80\x99s hands are flawed and cannot do such actions, especially tying rope knots around the victims\xe2\x80\x99 hands. Despite the finding, the team still tries to frame Baek but is thwarted by the villagers. The villagers wreak havoc during the remake and Baek is forcibly released. After losing the case, the Chief is reassigned to another case and a new Chief shows up. On the first day, the new Chief asks Park about the investigation\xe2\x80\x99s update. Still unsatisfied with the information, the Chief visits the first crime scene and Seo adds that the perpetrator only acts in the rain and only targets red-dressed women. He also adds that he found a missing person report that matches the crime\xe2\x80\x99s traits, and believes that there is a third victim that is yet to be found. Park denies the hypothesis but the Chief believes Seo. With Seo\xe2\x80\x99s leads, the team scopes through the location and finds the corpse. They are further convinced that the third victim fell to the same culprit since the features are present. Her hands are tied behind her back with the same knot, her face is covered by her underwear, and the culprit used her underwear to strangle her to death. Knowing the traits, they decide to bait the perpetrator. A woman is dressed in red and tasked to walk in the rain. However, the culprit ignores the bait. Meanwhile, a woman is walking in the rain when she suddenly hears a strange whistle. Afraid of the past incidents, she tries to run away but is caught by the culprit. Even though she was not wearing a red dress, the detectives conclude that the crime is done by the same perpetrator since all the other traits are present. In the office, a crew uncovers another characteristic where a certain Song is always played on a radio station, when the killings happen. The team rushes to the station to track the origin, but the radio crew has dumped the request letters. In the night, they decide to revisit the latest scene to look for more leads. There, they find a man trying to fantasize with women's underwear. The man admits that he just fantasizes things and hasn't done any crime. In the office, they continue to force him into confession despite the villagers' protest. The man ridicules the initiative by adding more to the story. He adds that there is a crazy person who lives in a school\xe2\x80\x99s restroom. Seo decides to look more into the story, so he visits the school\xe2\x80\x99s restroom in question. There, he meets a teacher who says that the suspected person is supposedly living in an outhouse nearby. In the outhouse, the crew finds that the suspect is actually a woman who is also a victim but survived. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t remember the culprit\xe2\x80\x99s face but remembers that the culprit\xe2\x80\x99s palms are soft like a woman\xe2\x80\x99s. In the office, Seo checks the previous suspect\xe2\x80\x99s palms and finds that his hands are rough, unlike the victim\xe2\x80\x99s description. Seo forces Park to release the suspect but they fight due to the difference in their belief. Suddenly, the Song which is also the perpetrator\xe2\x80\x99s trait is played on the radio amid the rain. Seo tries to ask the radio crew about the song request but is turned down. They try to request the policemen to do a search but are denied due to the riots in other cities. The next day, a woman is found dead in a field and is brought to the autopsy room. There, they find peach fruit inside the woman\xe2\x80\x99s private part, which is a new characteristic to the crime. Still clueless about the perpetrator, the team felt disappointed by their failure. Fortunately, a radio crew calls them and says that they\xe2\x80\x99ve found the request letter. Turns out, the requestor is Hyeon, who is a factory worker. They rush to Hyeon\xe2\x80\x99s house only to find his mother who tells them that Hyeon is working in the factory. Hyeon is determined as another suspect and is interrogated by the team. Seo finds that Hyeon\xe2\x80\x99s palms are soft just like the surviving victim says. They also find that he started to live in the village around September, the same as when the killings started. He also admits that he requests the Song everytime rain falls. Moreover, he also forgot about the last song that was played even though claiming that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave the house last night. As the crew desperately accuses Hyeon, he breaks and the situation intensifies. Cho kicks him in the chest and the Chief prohibits him from entering the interrogation room. When replaying the previous suspects\xe2\x80\x99 interrogation tapes, they realize that Baek\xe2\x80\x99s story is actually a description when he witnessed the killing. Baek witnessed the perpetrator\xe2\x80\x99s action while he was following the second victim. With the new lead, they visit Baek\xe2\x80\x99s house to look for him. But they find Cho instead. Cho is down after being scolded by the Chief, and takes it out on the customers who are dissing the detectives\xe2\x80\x99 effort in capturing the culprit. When Baek comes home, he tries to join the fight but punctures Cho\xe2\x80\x99s leg instead. He runs away but is caught by Park and Seo. When he is asked about the culprit\xe2\x80\x99s face, his father comes to rescue him. In the panic, Baek runs away but crashes into a running train and dies. Without any strong evidence, Hyeon is finally dismissed. The team is once again left without any leads. Luckily, another team finds the culprit\xe2\x80\x99s semen on one of the victims\xe2\x80\x99 corpses. The sample will be used for DNA matching with Hyeon\xe2\x80\x99s DNA. However, the test can only be carried out in America since they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the technology. While waiting for the result, Seo continues to stalk Hyeon for more leads. However, when Hyeon is leaving on a bus, Seo\xe2\x80\x99s car cannot start and he fails to follow him. The next morning, another victim is found by the police. A pen and a spoon is stuck inside the victim\xe2\x80\x99s private part. Seeing this, Seo regrets the situation deeply since the victim is a teenage girl who he knows, and he could\xe2\x80\x99ve prevented the killing if his car worked properly. Seo is enraged and beats Hyeon to make up for his regret. When he is about to shoot Hyeon, Park comes with the test result. Turns out, the DNA test comes out negative and Hyeon\xe2\x80\x99s DNA doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match with the culprit\xe2\x80\x99s. Hyeon is once again dismissed and the case is closed as unsolved. 17 years later, Park who has quitted his job as detective, revisits the first crime scene. There, a girl told him that a man also visited the same place some time ago to reminisce about his past actions. Realizing that the man could be the perpetrator, Park asks the girl about his face. She says that the man\xe2\x80\x99s face is plain, without any suspicion. In the end, Park looks into the camera as if he starts to look for the culprit once more, with a new broader lead.
