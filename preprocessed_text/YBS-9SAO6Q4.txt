Welcome to Cinema Summary ladies and gentlemen, and let me tell you: Siblings are a pain in the butt but they are family and sometimes they will be all that's left for you in this world. Now just so you know, this video will be split into 2 sections: a summary and an explanation section that will focus on things like autism about the legality of counting cards, as well as the man who the titular Rain Man is based upon If you\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen the movie and you're interested in those facts you can skip to this time code onscreen now but if you haven't already or just want a quick recap: This is Rain Man In the City of Angels, one Charlie Babbitt is busy at work: he\xe2\x80\x99s a douche-y looking yuppie who has a business selling luxury cars to clients. But things have turned for the worse as the most recent Lamborghini\xe2\x80\x99s he\xe2\x80\x99s planning on selling have been held up as they failed to meet the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s emission regulations which sucks as he really needs to sell these cars to their buyers so that he can pay back the loan he took out to buy the cars. So, he tries to keep his buyers interested and get an extension on his loan. He works with Lenny and Susanna, his girlfriend who he takes to go to Palm Springs though on their way there he gets a call from his dad\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, who tells him his father, Sanford Babbitt, has passed away. He heads to Cincinnati with Susanna to attend the funeral and we learn that at a young age, Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s mother died leaving him alone with his very distant dad, they had a falling out and since then Charlie has cut himself off from his dad. But he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to go to the funeral and head back to his old stomping ground. The house is empty and lifeless but in the garage is a beautiful old car full of memories, it\xe2\x80\x99s a 1949 Buick Roadster Convertible. An absolute gorgeous piece of machinery that had been a source of contention between Charlie and his dad who never let him drive the car and the one time that Charlie snuck out and took it for a joy ride with a few of his buddies: it led to him getting booked at the police station where his dad left him there for 2 days. Yeesh. Thankfully since his dad\xe2\x80\x99s dead, Charlie is going to get his inheritance which amounts to a couple of fancy rose bushes and the Buick Convertible with the $3 million-dollar estate going to an unnamed trustee. But with a little bit of digging, Charlie is able to figure out that the trustee is at the Wallbrook Institute, a mental hospital that caters towards people with special needs. While he\xe2\x80\x99s there, he encounters a peculiar man who recognizes the car Charlie drives as the strange man\xe2\x80\x99s dad let him drive the Buick when he was younger. Who\xe2\x80\x99s your dad? Sanford Babbit. And your mother? Eleanore Babbit. Charlie finds out from Dr. Bruner, that the strange man in question is: Raymond Babbit, his biological, blood brother who is a high functioning autistic. A condition that makes him quirky, being very focused on following routines, keeping things exactly where they are, and quoting Abbot and Costello under his breath to calm himself down. So, as a loving brother trying to \xe2\x80\x9cget to know\xe2\x80\x9d his newfound brother, Charlie takes Raymond out of Wallbrook and together with Susanna head to LA. On their way there, they stop and stay at a motel for the night which gets awkward as they try to deal with Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s eccentricities which leads to an argument breaking out between Susanna and Charlie about Charlie exploiting his brother for his $3 million dollars and Susanna leaves Charlie. The next day, the brothers have breakfast at a diner where Charlie gets on the phone with Dr. Bruner who insists on Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s return to Wallbrook. While Raymond is trying to get some toothpicks from a waitress, she drops the box of toothpicks spilling them on the floor and Raymond is able to count every single spilled toothpick in the blink of an eye. Something that Charlie takes note of but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think about. As they continue on their journey, things are getting worse for Charlie: whose loans are pass due and the cars he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to sell are still locked up. So, he tries to catch a flight to LA but Raymond refuses to get on any of the planes and freaks out when Charlie tries to drag him to the terminal so they drive there and while on the interstate highway system, a motor accident occurs and Raymond becomes deeply concerned with the danger of the road. So, they have to get off the highway and continue their journey, taking up even more time on what was supposed to be a 3-day drive to LA. However, after staying at a motel, they\xe2\x80\x99re held up by the rain which Raymond doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like so Charlie begins making calls to try to get an extension on the loan for his company. However, while making some calls, he discovers that Dr. Bruner never \xe2\x80\x98established a conservatorship of Raymond\xe2\x80\x99, therefore there\xe2\x80\x99s a high chance that Charlie can get custody of Raymond and of course the $3 million. They continue driving until they hit a town where Charlie takes Raymond to see a psychiatrist who although can\xe2\x80\x99t help Charlie too much does test Raymond on his ability to calculate numbers "Do you know how much the square root of 2130 is?" "46.15192304" demonstrates an immense talent for number crunching From there, they have frequent stops, phone calls concerning the state of the loans and Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s business, and stopping at motels for the night. Though at one motel, Charlie learns more about his brother and finds out that Raymond was or is Rain Man, his imaginary friend from childhood who was taken to Wallbrook after accidentally spilling hot water on Charlie when he was a baby. Their father having thought Raymond intentionally hurt Charlie, and kept Raymond at Wallbrook for his own sake. The following day, things get worse as Charlie finds out that the cars he was trying to sell were repossessed to pay off the late loans and the buyers for the cars want their money back now which totals to about $80,000 dollars. Money that Charlie doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have. He\xe2\x80\x99s screwed. They continue driving, passing through the Vegas Strip, and while at a diner Charlie has a eureka moment and discovers that Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s impeccable memory makes him perfect for counting cards So, they rush back to Vegas (after pawning off Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s watch for some cash), sprucing Raymond up and buying some new duds, they hit the Blackjack tables. Time after time getting winning hands, again and again. Which gets the attention of the Casino security who try to figure out how exactly they are cheating. After cashing out and many other things like Raymond getting the attention of a foxy vixen by the name of Iris, getting taught how to dance by Charlie, as well as Susanna\xe2\x80\x99s return to Charlie. Charlie is taken to meet with Mr. Kelso, the head of casino security who tells him to take his brother, leave Vegas with their winnings, and never come back. A generous offer that Charlie takes. After leaving Vegas, and dropping Susanna off at her apartment, the Babbitt Brothers head to Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s home in LA where Charlie meets with Dr. Bruner and they have a talk about Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s scheme to get the 3 million from Raymond via a custody battle. Not that it\xe2\x80\x99ll matter as Bruner doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to hand over any amount of the money from the trust to Charlie if he even can win custody and offers a cheque of 250,000 dollars to Charlie who rejects it because now it isn\xe2\x80\x99t about the money. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s about why the hell no one ever told him that he had a brother. Something that Bruner can\xe2\x80\x99t answer. The next morning, Raymond tries to make pancakes but accidentally sets off the smoke alarm the beeping from the alarm causes him to freak out and he only calms down after Charlie breaks the alarm. After breakfast, the Babbitts go to Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s custody hearing which ends with Charlie losing custody of Raymond as due to his condition, Raymond cannot make any decisions of his own and he cannot live safely or freely in the world outside of Wallbrook. But even with this sour taste in Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, there\xe2\x80\x99s a sweetness to this hearing: he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten to know his brother and learned to love him even with his quirks and after the hearing, they go to the Amtrak and say their goodbyes with Charlie giving Raymond a backpack full of all the things Raymond likes including a copy of Abbot &amp; Costello\xe2\x80\x99s Who\xe2\x80\x99s On First. And as Raymond goes to his seat, Charlie looks on: although he lost custody and his business is sunk At least he got to know his brother and is able to visit him when he wants to. Alright, so. The talking points of this section will be about with autism, it\xe2\x80\x99s depiction in the film, as well as the legality of counting cards, and the man who inspired Raymond Babbitt Now, autism is a real-world condition that is formally known as \xe2\x80\x9cautism spectrum disorder\xe2\x80\x9d which As depicted in the film, a few quirks of autistic individuals are delayed response, avoidance of eye contact, and impaired social skills along with emotional outbursts, repetition of words or phrases, abusing themselves, and an unusual tone of voice. All of which are demonstrated by Dustin Hoffman\xe2\x80\x99s impressive performance as Raymond Babbit, Now individuals with autism are often described as being low functioning or high functioning which based on my research is not a \xe2\x80\x9cclinical term\xe2\x80\x9d, it\xe2\x80\x99s more or less colloquial Now it's mentioned in the film that Raymond is a case of a high functioning autistic who This is mentioned by the psychiatrist that Raymond and Charlie visit that is to say that he's able to live in society, relatively undisturbed albeit needing some support of which Charlie is only able to provide some of Which brings me to the topic concerning savants of which Raymond is one of. Now savants are individuals with special needs or certain impairments who demonstrate an immense talent in a particular field, immense knowledge of a particular subject, or even a creative skill that seems out of place with their disability. Now, according to my research not every autist can or will be a savant and even then, autists can have natural talents towards something and they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be autistic in order to be a savant. Furthermore, autistic savants themselves don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be gifted in mental mathematics although usually they do demonstrate great memory like Raymond. A fascinating example of such a person is Mary Temple Grandin, or Temple Grandin" as she\'s usually known a who is a very visual thinker with photographic memory: able to memorize a lot of information and freely manipulate it in her mind. Although the memorization of things whether numbers, facts, entire books, or even cards can be more specific from person to person. Now something that Charlie mentions is that card counting is illegal which based on my research is not true although casino authorities do frown upon it Now in case you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know Card Counting is a strategy employed by gamblers for Blackjack, to maximize wins and minimize losses It revolves around a system of \xe2\x80\x98valuing\xe2\x80\x99 cards by how much of an advantage they give the player, betting high when the player has an advantage and betting low when they don\xe2\x80\x99t. Calculating the values of each player\xe2\x80\x99s hands on the fly while taking into account the number of decks remaining which for Raymond is easy to remember, the value easy to calculate, and in turn predicting what cards will turn up next is child\xe2\x80\x99s play for him. Now with that said, mentally counting cards is NOT illegal since it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect the outcome of the deal and it is a skill. An intellectual ability whereas using a machine or electronic device to count the cards is very much illegal which does make it a little strange that Charlie and Raymond were kicked out of the casino if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t utilize such means to win but they were unfair to the casino and one way or another, casino's don't like that one bit and as the old saying goes The House always wins. So, unless your Raymond yourself, I would suggest you stay away from casinos Which finally brings me to the man who inspired Raymond Babbitt: Kim Peek Kim Peek, who was not an autist but was a savant due to an abnormality in his brain that led to his two hemispheres being disconnected but that didn't stop him from being a walking, talking encyclopedia. You see, because of this abnormality in his brain, he had impeccable memory, was able to read incredibly quickly due to his ability to read 2 pages with both eyes, and also had an immense talent for being able to calculate what days of the wee a random date would be. Now how he ended up being the inspiration for Raymond is interesting Barry Morrow, the screenwriter for Rain man, met Peek in 1984, in Arlington, Texas at a meeting for the Association of Retarded Citizens, as Peek's dad was a chairman in a committee and before Morrow had written for a few TV movies about a 'retarded man named Bill'. Now supposedly they had a chat and Peek showed off his amazing memory to Morrow and screenwriter was inspired to write a character based on Peek and that's how Raymond was born and the critical success of Rain Man led to Peek gaining celebrity status and began touring around the country where he would advocate for the increased tolerance of the disabled It\xe2\x80\x99s strange to think that when he was a child, doctors said he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to read walk, or talk but by the time he died at the age of 58, he would\xe2\x80\x99ve walked more than a thousand steps, would\xe2\x80\x99ve talked more than a thousand words, and would\xe2\x80\x99ve memorized more than a thousand facts Kim Peek was an amazing person who led an extraordinary life, who in a way led to a resurgence in interest and knowledge amongst the general populace about autism and savants with that said, thank you so much for watching ladies and gentlemen if you enjoyed it leave a like down below and subscribe to get updated on my latest uploads
