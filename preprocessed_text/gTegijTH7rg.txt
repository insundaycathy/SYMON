The Ritual will give you another reason to avoid hiking in a desolate forest away from all the creature comforts you\xe2\x80\x99re addicted to. In this video on Nerd Explains, I'll summarize and explain The Ritual\xe2\x80\x99s story and ending. If you need a breakdown of the monster, if you want to know how to beat the monster, or just want to see all the kills and monster scenes, I'll have videos on all of these that you can check out. But this video\xe2\x80\x99s all about explaining the main events in The Ritual. The Ritual starts off rather casually, with a group of friends at a bar talking about vacation ideas. There\xe2\x80\x99s mention of Tuscany to get drunk, Ibiza to party, Amsterdam to get high, before landing on their soon-to-be most unforgettable trip idea, hiking the Kings Trail in Sweden where the Nordic gods are known for tormenting mortal humans. Luke and Robert then head to a liquor store to pick up some Vodka where they run into some junkies that end up killing Robert, after he refused to give them his wedding ring. Luke hides in the back of the store when all this goes down, to be forever stricken with survivors guilt from the incident, even though there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing he could have done, Luke isn\xe2\x80\x99t Michael Jai White. The thugs had knives and bats and would have killed him too. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t ease his burden. Flash forward and Luke emerges from a tent on the side of a mountain with his 4 friends, minus Robert of course. They decided to hike the trail in remembrance of Robert. They break camp and finally make it to the summit, where they honor their fallen friend with some final words, swigs of booze from a canteen, and a final libation, also known as pouring one out for their dead homie, also known as a ritual. They spend the night at the summit, where the air is heavy with thoughts of Robert. Hutch earnestly tells Luke that despite what others may think, Rob\xe2\x80\x99s death wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Luke\xe2\x80\x99s fault, but this falls on unbelieving ears. As they make their descent, Dom trips and hurts his leg. Hutch and Luke both scoff at how Dom is being over dramatic about his injury. This causes the crew to search for a quicker way off the mountain than was originally planned. Hutch, the pathfinder of the group, sets them on an uncharted, off-trail hike through a forest. This little shortcut would theoretically cut their journey in half, do \xe2\x80\x98em some good, and they\xe2\x80\x99d be in a lodge with their feet kicked up drinking some beers next to a warm fire. A real happily ever after fairy tale ending. But there\xe2\x80\x99s an hour and twenty minutes left in this horror movie, so it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say the shortcut won\xe2\x80\x99t be doing them any good. Before too long, they walk past an eerie abandoned van while cracking filthy jokes, while this is one of the movie's earliest warning signs, the mood is still light. It\xe2\x80\x99s not until they stumble into an elk strewn and hung from the trees with its intestines gutted, freshly dripping blood that they realize they may be in danger. Unfortunately for this group of friends, this is what you might call, strong foreshadowing. They wrongly mistake this for a deleted scene from Planet Earth and venture on. A thunderstorm erupts and forces them to find shelter, and what better place to shelter than an abandoned cabin in the woods. Better than a tent I suppose. While most of them unpack and settle in, Phil goes to check out the attic for firewood. He does find some, but it\xe2\x80\x99s stacked in the quite unsettling shape of a headless torso with antlers for arms, an effigy of sorts. They decide to use other things for firewood while discussing what the thing in their attic is before getting the worst sleep of their lives. Luke wakes up to a nightmare where he\xe2\x80\x99s back in the convenience store, except it\xe2\x80\x99s foresty, it\xe2\x80\x99s very trippy. He walks up to grab the same bottle of vodka he did when Robert was killed, then he gets metaphysically hooved in the chest by something, leaving a bloody wound. His nightmare crashes back into reality when the shelf of vodka seemingly gets ripped away from him and disappears, with an invisible monster running back into the forest. This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t solely a hallucination, as the bloody injury is still there when he wakes up. Luke returns to the cabin and finds Hutch wetting his bed, Dom crying in the corner, and Phil naked and praying to his Tinder date. Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bit unrealistic to assume it\xe2\x80\x99s a coincidence that all 4 of them had devastating night terrors where 2 of them did some form of sleepwalking. Something is toying with them, testing them, sizing them up. They leave the cabin in the morning to find that the trees have symbols carved into them. It\xe2\x80\x99s not clear if those symbols were there before the group walked into the cabin, but previously when look was shining his flashlight out there at night we see possibly the same trees that are untouched. They figure the symbols are warnings. These symbols are most likely Elder Futhark runes from the 2nd to the 8th centuries. The symbols translate roughly to the estate of a giant dangerous elk who provides liberation and new life from hardship. At least that\xe2\x80\x99s my interpretation from briefly studying ancient runes on Wikipedia. Dom, freaked out as he is, marches off on a path to civilization, or so he thinks, despite Hutch\xe2\x80\x99s valid concerns that they have no idea where it leads. After some hours of getting nowhere, Luke decides to run to the top of the ridge to get a better view. He crests the hill only to see more of the infinite forest, and one of the creepiest, spine-shivering moments of his life so far. Luke locks up when he sees something that looks like a hand grasping a tree, but it could just be part of the tree, until the thing that looks like a hand moves. He hightails it back to the group to tell them what he saw. Dom continues to lose his shit, dismissing and denying that Luke actually saw anything up there. The tension between the two culminates when Luke says that we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in this haunted forest if Dom hadn\xe2\x80\x99t screwed his knee. Dom retaliates with a mic dropping bomb, saying that we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for you, basically telling Luke that because he was a coward and let his friend get killed, they were hiking this mountain in his honor, where they are now faced with an impending doom. Man, camping trips can really put a strain on friendships. Their internal feud is quickly overshadowed by them stumbling across some fabric on the ground. They pull it out of the ground to realize that it\xe2\x80\x99s a tent, with boots, gear, a wallet and credit card all abandoned. The wallet contains a picture of a family, and the credit card holder is Anna Eriksen, expiring in 1984. Given everything the crew has been through up to this point, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to take this as anything but a terrible sign of what might happen to them. Hutch continues to be the strongest leader of the group, using logic, compasses, and calming the group by saying that they will get found. Hutch\xe2\x80\x99s words and hope are quickly extinguished when Dom mentions that it\xe2\x80\x99s getting dark again. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty apparent that the night is when things turn bad. Cut to night, they\xe2\x80\x99ve pitched tents and Hutch sizes up the group's health. Dom\xe2\x80\x99s knee is torn up, Phil is more mentally weakened, and Hutch tells Luke that he should take the compass, head South-West and try to make a break for civilization and bring back help while he stays with them. Hutch has this sort of, thousand yard stare thing going, like his mind is trying to find a way out of this predicament. While he was spreading hope earlier, deep down, he knows their situation is dire. Considering he\xe2\x80\x99s the most experienced hiker in the group, this is unnerving. They all get tucked into their tents for the night, and right when Luke goes for a midnight pop-tart snack, the forest comes alive. I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine how vulnerable it must feel being in a tiny tent, with a thin piece of fabric between you and a monster creeping through the woods just outside. Luke draws down the loudest zipper mankind has created, and most likely shit himself when he sees three shadowy figures in the forest, staring at him from the darkness. It\xe2\x80\x99s a PTSD trip like the one he had when he was hit in the chest, except in this nightmare, the mugger eerily makes eye contact with Luke, mocking him as a coward, before the forest erupts into branches breaking and trees moving around his tent. We get a jarring moment where Luke witnesses Hutch\xe2\x80\x99s tent being ripped up from the ground and sucked into the trees, where he then wakes up to Phil screaming and Hutch\xe2\x80\x99s bloody tent torn open, and Hutch missing. Luke\xe2\x80\x99s nightmares and reality don\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be two separate things. We then hear Hutch yelping in severe pain from deep in the forest. The remaining three friends courageously attempt a rescue, but as we all know, Hutch is pretty much a goner. At dawn, the search continues, where they stumble across their worst fears. Hutch, like the elk from earlier, is found gutted, hanging from the trees. It\xe2\x80\x99s an incredibly gruesome sight, and this is the exact moment when shit got real for the group. The hope of making it back in one piece is irreversibly over. This is the moment where their lives were permanently changed forever, or at least until they get hung from the trees too. This is also a huge blow because Hutch was the one leading them out of this mess, this most likely isn\xe2\x80\x99t a coincidence either. Phil says something interesting. He thinks the monster put Hutch\xe2\x80\x99s corpse on this path because it knew they were coming this way. Dom yet again loses his shit in denial, claiming that it was pagan hillbillies that did this. Luke steps into Hutch\xe2\x80\x99s bloody shoes as the fearless leader of the group, affirming that they are going to get out of the forest alive. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any of them actually believed it though. They find footprints leading somewhere, but they smartly avoid following them, choosing instead to go South-West as planned. As they ascend the ridge, we see the monster, perfectly camouflaged in the background. One could speculate that the footprints were incredibly obvious, and with the monster watching from a distance, this might have been some sort of trap. While Dom is panicky and hot-headed, Phil is something else. He looks pale and sickly, and it is deeply disturbed and mentally unstable. Stating that the monster got inside his head, made him pray to it, and that he can\xe2\x80\x99t get it out. I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to wonder how they thought they could make it out of the forest in less than one day. Even with all the events that have unfolded, it seems they should be close. Oh yep, they are close, just hours away, which might as well be a thousand miles considering night is now falling upon them. Let\xe2\x80\x99s just say, it\xe2\x80\x99s about to get bumpy. And Phil got rekted before the sun completely went down. At least he got the famous last words in, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I heard something,\xe2\x80\x9d before being dragged off screen to be slaughtered. Yes Phil, that was the sound of a giant forest monster lurking behind you. Luke springs into action, and with immense athleticism, manages to run into a tree and knock himself out, where he then wakes up at the familiar convenience store. Only this time, instead of the mugger calling him a coward, Robert tells Luke that he can\xe2\x80\x99t run. To which then, Luke proceeds to get up and run. Just like at the cabin, and the tent, the monster is communicating with Luke through the hallucinations. Luke finds Dom and they both cuddle up next to a tree, while Dom cries on Luke's shoulder and Luke says he\xe2\x80\x99ll never leave Dom under a moonlit night sky. On three they make a run for the treeline, but end up on a firelit path leading to either civilization or pagan hillbillies. Considering the monster is right behind them, they take the risk and follow the path. Just before they bolt, the flashlight illuminates Phils lifeless body, hanging from a tree. In sick irony, Phil saying that the monster put Hutch\xe2\x80\x99s body in their path so they would find it was exactly what happened to Phil. The monster is intelligently directing them, and placing their friends dead bodies in their path for them to see. As soon as Dom and Luke bust into the nearest cabin, they quickly realize it was a mistake, as the occupants aren\xe2\x80\x99t alarmed at the situation, it was almost as if they\xe2\x80\x99d been expecting the duo to show up. Luke also see\xe2\x80\x99s that they are praying to a stone carved with the representation of the Norse god Loki. The stone is called the Loki stone, and depicts Loki chained up. Probably not a good sign. It\xe2\x80\x99s confirmed that there will be no hospitality given here as they get face stomped into unconsciousness. They wake up in shackles with ritualistic chants roaring above them, people erecting human-sized crosses, and a creepy old lady feeding them water. Not exactly a 5-star bed and breakfast. The creepy old lady reveals she is injured in the same way Luke is. At this point it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that this injury is a mark of ritualistic importance. Unfortunately for Dom, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the mark, and is dragged into the attic to be blessed by prayers in preparation for his sacrifice. Yah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they were building a Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s outside after all. The cult brings Dom back inside so he can have one last chat with Luke before this evening\xe2\x80\x99s show. He reveals that earlier in the cabin, when Hutch was alive and pissing himself and he was in the corner crying and screaming the name Gayle, that his nightmare was the future prediction that he would end up here, being sacrificed to the monster. It brings a sense of dread and inevitability to the situation, which Dom obviously realizes by saying that he will die here. The monster literally forecasted everything that happened to the group. It\xe2\x80\x99s placement of Hutch and Phil\xe2\x80\x99s corpses was no coincidence. It herded them to the cult. Dom\xe2\x80\x99s chilling final request is that Luke burns the place to the ground, that he never stops, that he lives on as best he can, and to tell his wife he did what he could to get back to her. The cult marches Dom out to be sacrificed, where numerous other corpses are hanging from the tree\xe2\x80\x99s in full view. The sacrificial cross is actually in the shape as one of the symbols they saw earlier, which translates to elk. In an attempt to rescue Dom, Luke breaks his thumb in order to slip out of his shackles, he gets out of one, but cant get his other hand free. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure Luke could have done much if he did get free though. This is an important moment for Luke, as he was now ready to take personal injury while fighting for his friends. Despite his best efforts, he\xe2\x80\x99s too late. As was foretold in the nightmare, Gayle emerged from the woods. Only we know now that the monster has some form of telepathic abilities, and is assuming the figure of Dom\xe2\x80\x99s wife, before dragging him into the forest to be hung from the tree\xe2\x80\x99s. We do get a good look at the monster\xe2\x80\x99s face hole, and it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear this is nothing humans have encountered before. Why hang the bodies from the trees though, what significance does that have. It may be some sort of nod to other Norse mythology where the god Odin was said to gain knowledge and power by sacrificially impaling and hanging himself on a tree. Why did the monster need the cult to sacrifice Dom instead of hunting him like Hutch and Phil? Considering all the ritualistic worshiping, it appears to be more of the ego thing the monster has. Killing all the friends in the woods with nobody to see is like a basketball team playing with nobody in the stands. It\xe2\x80\x99s also a show of power to the cult, a warning. Why did the monster appear as Gayle? It may be it\xe2\x80\x99s ego and need to be revered and worshiped that caused the monster to appear as Gayle when killing Dom. Dom revered Gayle and the monster wanted to find someone to look at it like how Dom looks at Gayle. Another answer is that the monster despises people with good lives, as it cannot as easily convert them to a worshiper. It torments Dom by first appearing as Gayle, before revealing it\xe2\x80\x99s true grotesque nature as it kills him. Why did the monster choose Dom to sacrifice, and not the others? Possibly because Dom is wounded, and is easier for the cult to control. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the cult had the capacity to detain all four friends at once. They\xe2\x80\x99d pose too much of a danger. It killed off the stronger and healthier of the friends first. Dom, with his injured leg was an easier catch for the cult. A younger woman enters the cabin, who appears to be the little girl from the picture in the wallet at the abandoned tent the group found earlier. Luke asks if they took Dom\xe2\x80\x99s body down from the trees, to which she replies, we don\xe2\x80\x99t move the bodies. She tells Luke that the monster is an ancient nordic god named Moder, and is the slightly less charming offspring of Tom Hiddleston. The cult worships Moder, and in return it provides them with protection and everlasting life without pain, and if that sounds too good to be true, it\xe2\x80\x99s because it is. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not like you have a door number 2, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t worship it, you\xe2\x80\x99ll end up like Hutch, Phil, Dom, and countless others. We again see that this lady bears the mark that Luke has. When asked, why him, she responds that she believes it is because his pain is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s now that we\xe2\x80\x99re clued in that the god marks those it wants as worshippers, selecting only those with immense emotional baggage. This is another clue that this woman is the little girl from the picture, as she is distant and unsmiling while her family is happy and hugging each other, suggesting that she also carries great pain. The mark is over the heart, as this is traditionally where deep emotional pain is said to be felt. Back in the cabin where all the friends had nightmares, these nightmares were most likely caused by Moder gripping their hearts and feeling out which one of them it would choose. Dom was screaming for Gayle, possibly suggesting that he missed her and regretted not spending more time with her. Phil was praying to the effigy, possibly suggesting that he had some unresolved issues with a commitment to a religion or higher power. Hutch losing his bowels may suggest that his pain was in losing control, as he was the leader who seemingly always had a handle on the group, and was constantly trying to keep them on path. Obviously Luke, carrying the guilt from Rob's death at the liquor store, was the one whose heart the monster gripped the hardest. The monster clearly herded Luke to the cult instead of killing him, which it had plenty of opportunities to do earlier, so that he could become a worshiper of it. Now, our boy Luke has had some character development over the past hour and 20 minutes, he\xe2\x80\x99s not about to take any more shit from Loki\xe2\x80\x99s ugly ass son. He grabs a torch and heads upstairs to check out the congregation. Instead of opening the door to find Benny Hinn, Luke discovers probably the creepiest thing we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen yet. The worshipers are all mummified remains of elder cult members. He has some serious cojones for walking into that room, I'd have tossed the torch in and noped out of there. Remember when I said everlasting life was too good to be true, yah, this is Moders gift in all its glory. It\xe2\x80\x99s the hellacious side of everlasting life, as they aged but didn\xe2\x80\x99t die, and since their mummified remains can\xe2\x80\x99t ever leave, they are stuck in that attic, forced to worship Moder forever, well until Luke mercy kills them by lighting them all on fire, ultimately living up to his promise to Dom. Badass Luke absolutely rocks granny with a straight right jab, then grabs a german kar98k bolt action rifle and a couple rounds of 8mm ammo. On a side note, this could be a subtle indication that this monster god has been abducting hikers since before 1935. I mean obviously Moder\xe2\x80\x99s been around for awhile since he\xe2\x80\x99s an ancient god, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth pointing out. Moder returns from the woods, pissed off at his beautiful church being burned down. Luke blasts the creepy bald guy with his newfound rifle, then akimbos the rifle and an axe as he turns around to see Moder in the doorway, who drops the super dead eyes gouged out blonde woman to the ground as a kind of, see what you caused type of taunt. Earlier the blonde woman looked up at Moder and whispered a reply to it, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what she said, but I think fair to say that Moder is mad and punishing it\xe2\x80\x99s worshipers for allowing Luke to burn down the elders. Luke busts out the backdoor and into the woods while Moder picks up dead Annie, presumably to hang her from the trees. He fires the rifle at the monster with his last remaining round. We don\xe2\x80\x99t really know if Luke hit Moder with the bullet, but Moder seems pretty unphased. Moder is what you might consider to be, big game, which means one 8mm round won\xe2\x80\x99t do the trick anyway. Realizing this, Luke takes off for the treeline with the displeased monster chasing him down. That damn convenience store shows up again, meaning that he definitely did not lose Moder in the woods. He then gets bucked to the ground by the elk god, and now has Luke in his tiny hand\xe2\x80\x99s grasp. Just when you think Lukes about to become a tree ornament, Moder tosses him on the ground and starts flexing on him, establishing its dominance like a gorilla beating its chest. As soon as Luke stands up in defiance, Moder quickly shoves him back down into the kneeling position. Luke hallucinates one last time, and see\xe2\x80\x99s Robert on the ground next to him, Robert turns to look at him, almost as a suggestion from Moder that he needs to cowardly submit to Moder like he submitted to the muggers. It might not be those with great pain that the god chooses for worshipers, but instead it chooses those who are most likely to submit to it. We\xe2\x80\x99re led to believe it chooses the biggest cowards. I have some problems with this though, as after Hutch is killed it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that Luke ain\xe2\x80\x99t gonna be nobody's bitch, he\xe2\x80\x99s done being a coward and he assumed the stronger leader role, while Phil showed much less mental resolve and arguably would be an easier target. Though Phil\xe2\x80\x99s golden ticket may have been revoked because of his disrespect at the cabin earlier. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know though, earlier when they saw the footprints leading presumably to the cult camp, Phil was still alive. Moder may have actually wanted Phil too, but since they take the bait, it decided to kill him. The blonde lady did mention that Moder will take away their pain, so Luke\xe2\x80\x99s immense guilt is what might make him the target. In order for Moder to take away someone\xe2\x80\x99s pain as a motivation to become a worshiper, that person has to have pain to begin with. It\xe2\x80\x99s apparent now that Moder\xe2\x80\x99s main motivation is to satisfy it\xe2\x80\x99s ego by building a group of followers to worship it, much like an instagram ho. This is also maybe why it made Phil strip down naked and beg for his life to the headless antler-hand effigy for disrespecting it by saying "I\'ll pay a thousand to whoever shacks up with the thing tonight." Luke says fuck that noise, picks up the axe laying beside him that Moder seemed to forget about, and thrusts it into the monsters head, drawing the blood of the ancient god creature. Luke makes it to the treeline, where the forest seems to have some sort of electric shock collar fencing that Moder can\xe2\x80\x99t go beyond. It could also be interpreted that the monster is also a bit of a coward and all it\xe2\x80\x99s shenanigans were a defensive projection of it\xe2\x80\x99s own cowardice as it hides in the forest and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be seen in the open. Luke is barefoot and out of breath, he hasn't had time to grieve his dead friends. He's face to face with a mythical monster. It roars in anger, Luke, too stricken to feel fear of death screams back in sadness and defiance. He's no longer a coward, but what does it matter when all his friends were murdered. How can he even begin to explain or cope with what he has endured. The movie leaves Luke to make his solitary journey back home so he can be imprisoned as he\xe2\x80\x99s painted as a mentally unstable PTSD afflicted person who lost his mind and murdered his friends in the forest. What, did you think we\xe2\x80\x99d really believe an ancient monster god killed them? What he should have done, is kept the axe he used to draw the god\xe2\x80\x99s blood, and used that as biological evidence of an unworldly creature that attacked them. If you want to know more about how to beat Moder, I'll have a video on that as well. Anyways, this movie had more depth and raised more questions than I expected, so let me know what you guys thought of it! Thanks for watching!
