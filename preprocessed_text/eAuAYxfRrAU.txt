Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen. Today\xe2\x80\x99s movie is a timeless love story with love, letters and a mailbox. This is The Lake House. The movie starts off with a woman named Kate Forrester leaving a lake house, putting her things in her car all except a letter that she leaves in the mailbox. As she drives away in autumn, a man named Alex Wyler checks out the lake house in winter. That night, he moves in, taking the letter from the mailbox as he does so. It\xe2\x80\x99s from Kate who welcomes the new tenant to the house and politely asks that the new tenant forward any mail that might have accidentally been sent to the lake house, since she\xe2\x80\x99s moved to Chicago. And she ends it with a PS, apologizing for the pawprints on the dock and the box in the attic to which Alex is left wondering "What pawprints? What box is she talking about?" The next day, Alex is painting the railings. But as he\xe2\x80\x99s painting, a dog runs through his paint tray, running into his house, making paw prints on the dock. In Chicago, Kate is eating with her mom at Daley Plaza. It\xe2\x80\x99s a hot and noisy Valentines Day and as they are eating lunch, a bus runs into a man and Kate rushes to save him. But we find out that she failed to save him, and after a talk with her boss her boss suggests that she take some days off so she goes to the Lake House with her dog Jack. She checks the mailbox for mail and takes out a letter. It\xe2\x80\x99s from Alex, who tells her that she\xe2\x80\x99s mistaken. According to Alex, the house has been abandoned for years and he thinks that maybe she was writing the letter for someone else. He ends the letter, asking her how she knew about the pawprints. She\xe2\x80\x99s a little upset with him in her next letter. No. She meant to write to whoever was moving into the lake house. She used to live there and since she has moved. And she\xe2\x80\x99d like it very much if he sent her any mail at her new address in Chicago. Oh and he\xe2\x80\x99s wrong about the whole house was empty for several years thing. It\xe2\x80\x99s 2006 and someone was living there before her. And Alex is just confused by the letter, this time What does she mean saying its 2006? Alex goes to Chicago to reunite with his brother, Henry. Who is an architect working for their workaholic father, Simon. The two brothers catch up and Alex tells Henry all about the lake house and his new dog which is the same dog that made the paw prints. After the reunion, Alex goes to Kate\xe2\x80\x99s address, to deliver a letter, and we find out, that the building is still under construction. He goes back to the lake house and leaves his letter in the mailbox: telling her that her home is still under construction and he points out that she got the year wrong. It\xe2\x80\x99s not 2006. It\xe2\x80\x99s 2004. But Alex is a man talking to a woman so of course he\xe2\x80\x99s wrong! She scrounges around her apartment until she finds a photo dated April 4th, 2004 (04/03/2004). Supposedly Jack the Dog didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the late snow that spring. So Kate decides to play along with Alex, warning him that \xe2\x80\x9cIf you really are in 2004, you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna get some late spring snow.\xe2\x80\x9d and she gives him a scarf to keep him warm. Alex thinks she\xe2\x80\x99s just being \xe2\x80\x98cute\xe2\x80\x99 and chuckles at her prediction and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe a word. Until he turns around and sees the first fall of snow and he\xe2\x80\x99s awestruck by the weather and that last letter from Kate. The next morning is pretty-chilly but Alex still goes out and leaves a letter in the mailbox. When Kate pulls out his letter from the mailbox, it reads \xe2\x80\x9cCan this be happening?\xe2\x80\x9d. And as he\xe2\x80\x99s walking back inside, Alex is surprised to see the mailbox\xe2\x80\x99s flag go up. There in the mailbox, that had Alex\xe2\x80\x99s letter minutes ago, is an envelope. From Kate, reading \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d. Neither of them see anyone deliver a letter, but their mailboxes somehow get letters. Without anyone delivering them. So just to be clear: Alex is in the year 2004 and Kate is in the year 2006. It seems like the mailbox is a portal between 2 separate dimensions, 2 timelines: where it\xe2\x80\x99s either 2 years in the future or 2 years in the past. and using this, they are able to send each other letters as well as as a scarf. Both to and from the future or the past, so! This movie uses 2 different timelines where people are able to talk to each other. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see if this theory holds true, and nail down the rules this movie follows. Back to the movie. So, Kate and Alex decide to properly introduce themselves to each other. She\xe2\x80\x99s a doctor and he\xe2\x80\x99s an architect and through the letters they have some playful interactions and learn more about each other. Like in one letter, they talk about the paw prints, and by coincidence they realize that they both have the same dog. In fact, Kate tells Alex the dog\xe2\x80\x99s name is Jack and for some reason the dog seems to respond to the name after Alex calls her. There\xe2\x80\x99s this one time when Alex gives Kate a map of Chicago with a route to follow. She ends up next to a building where Alex had spray-painted message to her. There\xe2\x80\x99s also this one letter to Alex, where Kate mentions that she misses seeing the trees, that grow around the lake house. So, Alex plants a sapling at the place where Kate lives in the future. And we see, in the future, Kate go back home one day while it is raining and then suddenly, the tree is there. Now fully grown. Did you see that? The moment Alex plants the tree, it pops up in the future. Kate sees this and she\xe2\x80\x99s confused by it because she remembers that the tree not being there What does this mean? Well, this means that the first theory was wrong. It seems like this movie has one timeline where the past affects the future. So if you plant a tree in the past, it grows up, becoming fully-grown in the future which makes sense But then why does Kate remember the tree not being there? Stay tuned, because we are gonna find out what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here. In another letter from Kate, she mentions that she lost a book: a copy of Persuasion by Jane Austen at the train station in the past. She asks him if he can get it for her and so, Alex goes there, and he sees Kate there, and she\xe2\x80\x99s with her then boyfriend. Morgan She says goodbye, never noticing Alex, and leaves her book and Alex tries to return it: Running after her. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it in time. But through the windows of the train, they make eye contact and this is the first time that they have ever seen each other. After the train station thing, he asks her out on a date. Kate asks him to call her on July 10, 2006. The day she\xe2\x80\x99s writing the letter. When coincidentally the phone rings! And it\xe2\x80\x99s Morgan, Kate\xe2\x80\x99s Ex-boyfriend. They go out that night and Morgan and Kate start arguing. Why? Because of some random guy that Kate kissed years ago at some party. Back in the past, Jack the Dog runs away, so Alex and Mona (a women who is obsessed with Alex) chase after the dog. Alex and Mona find Jack at a house, where they meet Morgan who at this given moment is Katie's boyfriend in 2004. They have a brief chat and Alex mentions to Morgan that he\xe2\x80\x99s been living at a lake house. To which Morgan is like "That\'s very interesting, my girlfriend is really interested in a place near a lake, as well y\'know?" "Oh and speaking of my girlfriend, we\'re having a party with her tonight. Why don\'t you guys come over?" "Whose your girlfriend?" "Kate." So of course, Alex goes with single goal in mind: to find Kate In 2006 at the bar, Kate is drinking on her birthday and here she has a heart to heart with her boss. Kate tells her about Alex and how the one guy she truly wants to be with is the one she never can be with. Back in the past, Morgan introduces Kate to Mona and Alex and when Kate goes out for some fresh air, Alex follows her. They have a small talk, and it's a nice little moment between the two of them. After that they share a dance and a few little kisses under the moonlight until Morgan and Mona catch them making out. As Kate is drinking, it all comes together: Alex was the guy that Kate had kissed at a party years ago. Alex is the guy who Morgan is angry at and she's shocked that she hadn't put it together until now Sometime after the party, Alex gets a phone call It\xe2\x80\x99s about his dad, Simon. He goes to a hospital in Chicago to see his dad where he learns what happened. His dad had a heart attack, but he\xe2\x80\x99s alive and Alex stays the night with his dad. In the future, Kate is going through the archives where she finds out that that Alex\xe2\x80\x99s dad has died. As Alex goes back to the lake house, he gets a call, and now he finds out that his dad has died and he spends his time at the lake house grieving but he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to move on. Sometime later, Alex decides to something a little crazy: He wants to meet Kate, and together they set up a dinner date. 2 years in the future for Alex, and tomorrow for Kate. They\xe2\x80\x99re preparing, it\xe2\x80\x99s ready, she comes all dressed up, and orders a glass of wine and she waits. But no one shows up. There\xe2\x80\x99s no sign of Alex anywhere and Kate is absolutely devastated. In her final letter to Alex, Kate tells him to stop writing to her and to leave her alone because she\xe2\x80\x99s realized that this relationship just won\xe2\x80\x99t work out. and Alex argues to try again but she\xe2\x80\x99s not having it. Life isn\xe2\x80\x99t a story where you always get the chance to meet someone, Alex. Life is random and its fragile But he continues to write to her waiting for the chance that maybe, maybe she\xe2\x80\x99s changed her mind and she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t. In the future, Kate starts dating Morgan again, she\xe2\x80\x99s fully dedicated to moving on and for her life\xe2\x80\x99s better. Soon, Alex himself moves on: after Jack runs away, Alex puts the letters from Kate in a cardboard box that he puts in the attic. This is same box that Kate mentioned at the beginning of the film; in her letter. That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there when he got there, but was there because he left it there. He leaves the lake house, driving over to Morgan\xe2\x80\x99s office and gives Morgan the keys to the Lake House. After Alex drives off, Jack the dog shows up and is taken in by Morgan. Alex moves on from Kate and moves in with his brother, in a Chicago apartment where Alex begins redesigning the lake house. 2 years later, in 2008, Morgan and Kate live together That Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day, in 2008 Kate and Morgan go to meet an architect Henry Wyler, Alex\xe2\x80\x99s brother At same time in 2006, the Wyler brothers leave their apartment and while walking, Henry reveals his plan for Valentine's Day and then Alex remembers one of Kate\xe2\x80\x99s letters. She mentioned that there was something important that happened on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day in Chicago and he rushes back to the Lake house At the architect\xe2\x80\x99s office, Kate spots a concept piece of the lakehouse and asks Henry who drew it. He replies that his brother did. Did you know him? She tells him she did and asks if there's any way she can get in touch with him. And we find out that he died 2 years ago, on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day, in an accident at Daley Plaza. Kate remembers what happened 2 years ago on Valentines Day: the bus crash! So, Kate rushes to the lake house hoping to warn him not to leave the lake house today because Kate figures out that it was Alex who died that day in 2006. Kate frantically writes one final letter: confessing her love for Alex and begging him to stay away; don\xe2\x80\x99t go. Wait 2 years and meet her at the lakehouse, please. So just to be clear: Alex is dead. He\xe2\x80\x99s been dead since 2006. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t call her and why he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at the dinner date: he was dead the whole time but we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna see something that changes our understanding of how time works in this movie. So stick around. Alex goes to the attic, opening the box full of letters that she sent. He\xe2\x80\x99s looking for the last letter that she ever sent to him. Because in that letter Kate mentions that she was at Daley Plaza in 2006 on Valentine's Day He knows where Kate is now and this might be his chance meet her. Alex goes to the plaza and when he sees Kate, he starts to cross the road as the bus starts moving. As for Kate? She\xe2\x80\x99s crying and hoping that he got the letter in time. Hoping that he\xe2\x80\x99s still alive. And then we see a familiar truck and a man exits: it\xe2\x80\x99s Alex! He rushes out to to hold her in his arms and kiss her. They are finally reunited, and the movies ends with them arm-in-arm, walking into the lake house. You\xe2\x80\x99re probably wondering what just happened, right? If Alex was the man who died on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day, how come he's still alive in the end? The only thing that makes sense to me is that Alex and Kate can change history and when they do so, they 'jump' timelines. This is most obvious at the end where Kate writes the letter that saves Alex's life the letter causes both of them to jump to a timeline where Alex never died and in this new timeline: Alex lives, waits 2 years, and then goes to the lake house. For him: he never died. For Kate? She remembers that he did which is why she\xe2\x80\x99s waiting at the lake house Her letter changed the timelines for both of them and she\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for the changes to take effect. So I've given you 3 theories, right? And believe conclusively that this movie uses multiple timelines to explain how time travel works. But that's just what I think, I really want to know what you guys think so leave your ideas and theories in the comments down below With that being said, thank you so much for watching.
